<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">A NOTE ON CLASSICAL ALLUSIONS TO THE DARDS AND
TO GREEK INFLUENCE ON INDIA.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Dards.</span></h3>

<p>Herodotus (III. 102-105) is the first author who refers to the country of
the Dards, placing it on the frontier of Kashmir and in the vicinity of
Afghanistan. “Other Indians are those who reside on the frontiers of the
town ‘Kaspatyros’ and the Paktyan country; they dwell to the north of
the other Indians and live like the Baktrians; they are also the most warlike
of the Indians and are sent for the gold,” etc. Then follows the
legend of the gold-digging ants (which has been shown to have been the
name of a tribe of Tibetans by Schiern), and on which, as an important
side-issue, consult Strabo, Arrian, Dio Chrysostomus, Flavius Philostratus
the elder, Clemens Alexandrinus, Ælian, Harpokration, Themistius
Euphrades, Heliodorus of Emesa, Joannes Tzetzes, the Pseudo-Kallisthenes
and the scholiast to the Antigone of Sophocles<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>—and among
Romans, the poems of Propertius, the geography of Pomponius Mela, the
natural history of the elder Pliny and the collections of Julius Solinus.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The Mahabharata also mentions the tribute of the ant-gold “paipilika”
brought by the nations of the north to one of the Pandu sons, king
Yudhisthira.</p>

<p>In another place Herodotus [IV. 13-27] again mentions the town of
Kaspatyros and the Paktyan country. This is where he refers to the
anxiety of Darius to ascertain the flow of the Indus into the sea. He
accordingly sent Skylax with vessels. “They started from the town of
Κασπάτυρος and the Πακτυική χώρη towards the east to the sea.” I take
this to be the point where the Indus river makes a sudden bend, and for
the first time actually does lie between Kashmir and Pakhtu-land (for this,
although long unknown, must be the country alluded to),<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in other words,
below the Makpon-i-Shang-Rong, and at Bunji, where the Indus becomes
navigable.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The Paktyes are also mentioned as one of the races that
followed Xerxes in his invasion of Hellas (Herod. VII. 67-85). Like our
own geographers till 1866, Herodotus thought that the Indus from that
point flowed duly from north to south, and India being, according to his
system of geography, the most easterly country, the flow of the Indus was
accordingly described as being easterly. I, in 1866, and Hayward in 1870,
described its flow from that point to be due west for a considerable
distance (about one hundred miles). (The <span class="smcap">Paktyes</span> are, of course, the
Afghans, called Patans, or more properly <span class="smcap">Pakhtus</span>, the very same Greek
word). “Kaspatyros” is evidently a mis-spelling for “Kaspapyros,” the
form in which the name occurs in one of the most accurate codes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Intro_Page_2" id="Intro_Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Herodotus which belonged to Archbishop Sancroft (the Codex Sancroftianus)
and which is now preserved at Emmanuel College, Cambridge.
Stephanus Byzantianus (A.V.) also ascribes this spelling to Hekatœus of
Miletus.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Now Kaspapyros or Kaspapuros is evidently <i>Kashmir</i> or “<i>Kasyapapura</i>,”
the town of <i>Kasyapa</i>, the founder of Kashmir, and to the present day one
may talk indifferently of the town of Kashmir, or of the country of
<i>Kashmir</i>, when mentioning that name, so that there is no necessity to seek
for the <i>town</i> of Srinagar when discussing the term Kaspatyrus, or, if
corrected, Kaspapuros, of Herodotus.</p>

<p>Herodotus, although he thus mentions the people (of the Dards) as one
neighbouring (πλησιοχώροι) on Kashmir and residing between Kashmir and
Afghanistan, and also refers to the invasions which (from time immemorial
it may be supposed, and certainly within our own times) this
people have made against Tibet for the purpose of devastating the goldfields
of the so-called ants, does not use the name of “Dard” in the above
quotations, but Strabo and the elder Pliny, who repeat the legend, mention
the very name of that people as <i>Derdæ</i> or <i>Dardæ</i>, vide Strabo XV., ἐν
Διρδαις ἔθνει μεγάλω τῶν προσεώων καὶ ὀρείνων Ἰνδῶν. Pliny, in his Natural
History, XI. 36, refers to “<i>in regione Septentrionalium Indorum, qui Dardæ
vacantur</i>.” Both Pliny and Strabo refer to Megasthenes as their authority
in Chapter VI., 22. Pliny again speaks of “<i>Fertilissimi sunt auri
Dardæ.</i>” The Dards have still settlements in Tibet where they are
called Brokhpa (<a href="#Page_60">see page 60 of text</a>). The Dards are the “Darada”
of the Sanscrit writers. The “Darada” and the “Himavanta” were the
regions to which Buddha sent his missionaries, and the Dards are finally
the “Dards, an independent people which plundered Dras in the last year,
has its home in the mountains three or four days’ journey distant, and
talks the <i>Pakhtu</i> or <span class="smcap">Daradi</span> language. Those, whom they take prisoners
in these raids, they sell as slaves” (as they do still). (Voyage par Mir
Izzetulla in 1812 in Klaproth’s Magasin Asiatique, II., 3-5.) (The above
arrangement of quotations is due to Schiern.)<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Influence of Greece on Asia in General and India in
Particular.</span></h3>

<p>The most important contribution to this question, however, is Plutarch’s
<i>Speech</i> on Alexander’s fortune and virtue (περὶ Ἀλεξάνδρου τύχης καὶ
ἀρετῆς), the keynote to which may be found in the passage which contains
the assertion that he Κατέσπειρε τὴν Ἀσίαν ἑλληνικοῖς τέλεσι, but the
whole speech refers to that marvellous influence.</p>

<p>That this influence was at any rate believed in, may be also gathered
from a passage in Aelian, in which he speaks of the Indians and Persian
kings singing Homer in their own tongues. I owe the communication of
this passage to Sir Edward Fry, Q.C., which runs as follows; Ὄτι Ἰνδοὶ τῆ
παρα σφίσιν ἐπιχωριά φωνη τά Ὁμήρου μεταγράψαντις ᾄδουσιν οὐ μάνοι, ἀλλὰ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Intro_Page_3" id="Intro_Page_3">[3]</a></span>
καὶ οἲ Περσῶν βασιλεῖς εὶ τι χρη πιστεύειν τοῖς ὕπερ τούτων ἱστοροῦσι.—Aeliani
Variæ Historiæ, Lib. XII., Cap. 48. [I find from a note in my
edition that Dio Chrysostom tells the same story of the Indians in his
53rd Oration.—E.F.]</p>

<p>I trust to be able to show, if permitted to do so, in a future note (1) that
the Aryan dialects of Dardistan are, at least, contemporaneous with
Sanskrit, (2) that the Khajuná is a remnant of a prehistoric language, (3)
that certain sculptors followed on Alexander’s invasion and taught the
natives of India to execute what I first termed “Græco-Buddhistic”
sculptures, a term which specifies a distinct period in history and in the
history of Art.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">G. W. Leitner.</span></p>

<p>P.S. in 1893.—The above, which appeared in “the Calcutta Review” of
January 1878, was also reprinted in the <i>Asiatic Quarterly Review</i> of April
1893 with reference to Mr. J. W. McCrindle’s recent work on “Ancient
India: Its Invasion by Alexander the Great,” in which he omits to draw
attention to the importance of Plutarch’s <i>Speech</i> on the civilizing results of
Alexander’s invasion, and makes no mention whatever of the traces which
Greek art has left on the Buddhistic sculptures of the Panjab.</p>

<p>He only just mentions Plutarch’s speech on page 13 of his otherwise
excellent work, published by Messrs. Constable of 14 Parliament Street,
London. As that speech, which is divided into two parts, is, however, of
the utmost importance in showing what were believed to be in Plutarch’s
days the results of Alexander’s mission, I think it necessary to quote some
of the most prominent passages from it relating to the subject under
inquiry. I also propose to show in a monograph on the græco-buddhistic
sculptures, now at the Woking Museum, which I brought from beyond the
Panjab frontier, that Alexander introduced not only Greek Art but also
Greek mythology into India. I will specially refer to the “Pallas Athene,”
“the rape of Ganymede,” and “the Centaur” in my collection, leaving
such sculptures as “Olympian games,” “Greek soldiers accompanying
Buddhist processions,” “the Buddhist Parthenon,” [if not also Silanion’s
“Sappho with the lyre,”]—all executed by Indian artists—to tell their own
tale as to the corroborations in sculpture of passages in ancient Greek and
Roman writers relating to the genial assimilation of Eastern with Western
culture which the Great Conqueror of the Two Continents, “the possessor
of two horns,” the “Zu’l-Qarnein” (Al-Asghar) of the Arabs, endeavoured
to bring about.</p>

<p>The following passages from Plutarch’s Speech may, I hope, be read with
interest. The author endeavours to answer his question as to whether
Alexander owed his success “to his fortune or to his virtue” by showing
that he was almost solely indebted to his good qualities:</p>

<p>“The discipline of Alexander ... oh marvellous philosophy, through
which the Indians worship the Greek gods.”</p>

<p>“When Alexander had recivilized Asia, they read Homer and the
children of the Persians ... sang the tragedies of Euripides and Sophocles.”
“Socrates was condemned in Athens because he introduced foreign Gods
... but, through Alexander, Bactria and the Caucasus worshipped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Intro_Page_4" id="Intro_Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Greek Gods.” “Few among us, as yet, read the laws of Plato, but myriads
of men use, and have used, those of Alexander, the vanquished deeming
themselves more fortunate than those who had escaped his arms, for the
latter had no one who saved them from the miseries of life, whilst the
conqueror had forced the conquered to live happily.”</p>

<p>“Plato only wrote one form of Government and not a single man
followed it because it was too severe, whereas Alexander founded more
than 70 cities among barbarous nations and permeating Asia with Hellenic
Institutions....” Plutarch makes the conquered say that if they had not
been subdued “Egypt would not have had Alexandria nor India Bucephalia,”
that “Alexander made no distinction between Greek and Barbarian,
but considered the virtuous only among either as Greek and the vicious as
Barbarian” and that he by “intermarriages and the adaptation of customs
and dresses sought to found that union which he considered himself as
sent from heaven to bring about as the arbitrator and the reformer of the
universe.” “Thus do the wise unite Asia and Europe.” “By the adoption
of (Asiatic) dress, the minds were conciliated.” Alexander desired
that “One common justice should administer the Republic of the Universe.”</p>

<p>“He disseminated Greece and diffused throughout the world justice and
peace.” Alexander himself announces to the Greeks, “Through me you
will know them (the Indians) and they will know you, but I must yet strike
coins and stamp the bronze of the barbarians with Greek impressions.”
The fulfilment of this statement is attested by the Bactrian coins. I submit
that he who left his mark on metal did so also on sculpture, as I have
endeavoured to show since 1870 when I first called my finds “græco-buddhistic,”
a term which has, at last, been adopted after much opposition,
as descriptive of a period in History and in the history of Art and
Religion.</p>

<p>[The above quotations are all from the 1st Part of Plutarch’s oration;
the second is reserved for the proposed monograph.]</p>

<p>Demons are of a gigantic size, and have only <i>one eye,
which is on the forehead</i>. They used to rule over the
mountains and oppose the cultivation of the soil by man.
They often dragged people away into their recesses. Since
the adoption of the Muhammadan religion, the demons
have relinquished their possessions, and only occasionally
trouble the believers.</p>

<p>They do not walk by day, but confine themselves to
promenading at night. A spot is shown near Astor, at a
village called Bulent, where five large mounds are pointed
out which have somewhat the shape of huge baskets.
Their existence is explained as follows. A Zemindar
(cultivator) at Grukot, a village farther on, on the Kashmir
road, had, with great trouble, sifted his grain for storing,
and had put it into baskets and sacks. He then went away.
The demons came—five in number—carrying huge leather-sacks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
into which they put the grain. They then went to a
place which is still pointed out and called “<i>Gué</i> Gutume
Yatsheyn gau boki,” or “The place of the demons’ loads
at the hollow”—Gué being the Shiná name for the present
village of Grukōt. There they brought up a huge flat
stone—which is still shown—and made it into a kind of pan,
“tawa,” for the preparation of bread. But the morning
dawned and obliged them to disappear; they converted the
sacks and their contents into earthen mounds, which have
the shape of baskets and are still shown.</p>

<h4>1.—<span class="smcap">The Wedding of Demons.</span></h4>

<p>A Shikari (sportsman) was once hunting in the hills.
He had taken provisions with him for five days. On the
sixth day he found himself without any food. Excited and
fatigued by his fruitless expedition, he wandered into the
deepest mountain recesses, careless whither he went as
long as he could find water to assuage his thirst, and a few
wild berries to allay his hunger. Even that search was unsuccessful,
and, tired and hungry, he endeavoured to compose
himself to sleep. Even that comfort was denied him,
and, nearly maddened with the situation, he again arose and
looked around him. It was the first or second hour of
night, and, at a short distance, he descried a large fire
blazing a most cheerful welcome to the hungry, and now
chilled, wanderer. He approached it quietly, hoping to
meet some other sportsman who might provide him with
food. Coming near the fire, he saw a very large and
curious assembly of giants, eating, drinking, and singing.
In great terror, he wanted to make his way back, when one
of the assembly, who had a squint in his eye, got up for the
purpose of fetching water for the others. He overtook him,
and asked him whether he was a “child of man.” Half
dead with terror, he could scarcely answer that he was,
when the demon invited him to join them at the meeting,
which was described to be a wedding party. The Shikari
replied: “You are a demon, and will destroy me”; on
which the spirit took an oath, <i>by the sun and the moon</i>, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
he certainly would not do so. He then hid him under a
bush and went back with the water. He had scarcely
returned when a plant was torn out of the ground and a
small aperture was made, into which the giants managed to
throw all their property, and, gradually making themselves
thinner and thinner, themselves vanished into the ground
through it. Our sportsman was then taken by the hand by
the friendly demon, and, before he knew how, he himself
glided through the hole and found himself in a huge apartment,
which was splendidly illuminated. He was placed in
a corner where he could not be observed. He received
some food, and gazed in mute astonishment on the assembled
spirits. At last, he saw the mother of the bride
taking her daughter’s head into her lap and weeping bitterly
at the prospect of her departure into another household.
Unable to control her grief, and in compliance with an old
Shîn custom, she began the singing of the evening by
launching into the following strains:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Translation</span>:—</p>

<p>“Oh, Biráni, thy mother’s own; thou, little darling, wilt wear ornaments,
whilst to me, who will remain here at Buldar Butshe, the heavens will

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The Shikari began to enjoy the scene and would have
liked to have stayed, but his squinting friend told him now
that he could not be allowed to remain any longer. So he
got up, but before again vanishing through the above-mentioned
aperture into the human world, he took a good
look at the demons. To his astonishment he beheld on
the shoulders of one a shawl which he had safely left at
home. Another held his gun; a third was eating out of
his own dishes; one had his many-coloured stockings on,
and another disported himself in pidjamas (drawers) which
he only ventured to put on, on great occasions. He also
saw many of the things that had excited his admiration
among the property of his neighbours in his native village,
being most familiarly used by the demons. He scarcely
could be got to move away, but his friendly guide took
hold of him and brought him again to the place where he
had first met him. On taking leave he gave him three
loaves of bread. As his village was far off, he consumed
two of the loaves on the road. On reaching home, he
found his father, who had been getting rather anxious at
his prolonged absence. To him he told all that had happened,
and showed him the remaining loaf, of which the old
man ate half. His mother, a good housewife, took the remaining
half and threw it into a large granary, where, as it
was the season of Sharó (autumn), a sufficient store of
flour had been placed for the use of the family during the
winter. Strange to say, that half-loaf brought luck, for
demons mean it sometimes kindly to the children of men,
and only hurt them when they consider themselves offended.
The granary remained always full, and the people of the
village rejoiced with the family, for they were liked and
were good people.</p>

<p>It also should be told that as soon as the Shikari came
home he looked after his costly shawl, dishes, and clothes,
but he found all in its proper place and perfectly uninjured.
On inquiring amongst his neighbours he also found that they
too had not lost anything. He was much astonished at all
this, till an old woman who had a great reputation for wisdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
told him that this was the custom of demons, and that
they invariably borrowed the property of mankind for their
weddings, and as invariably restored it. On occasions of
rejoicings amongst them they felt kindly towards mankind.</p>

<p>Thus ends one of the prettiest tales that I have heard.</p>

<h4>2.—<span class="smcap">The Demon’s Present of Coals is Turned into Gold.</span></h4>

<p>Something similar to what has just been related, is said
to have happened at Doyur, on the road from Gilgit to
Nagyr. A man of the name of Phûko had a son named
Laskirr, who, one day going out to fetch water was caught
by a Yatsh, who tore up a plant (“reeds”?) “phuru” and
entered with the lad into the fissure which was thereby
created. He brought him to a large palace in which a
number of goblins, male and female, were diverting themselves.
He there saw all the valuables of the inhabitants
of his village. A wedding was being celebrated and the
mother sang:—</p>

<p>On his departure, the demon gave him a sackful of coals,
and conducted him through the aperture made by the
tearing up of the reed, towards his village. The moment
the demon had left, the boy emptied the sack of the coals
and went home, when he told his father what had happened.
In the emptied sack they found a small bit of coal, which,
as soon as they touched it, became a gold coin, very much
to the regret of the boy’s father, who would have liked his
son to have brought home the whole sackful.</p>

<h3 id="B_Fairies">B.—<span class="smcap">“Barai,” “Peris,” “Fairies.”</span></h3>

<p>They are handsome, in contradistinction to the Yatsh
or Demons, and stronger; they have a beautiful castle on
the top of the Nanga Parbat or Dyarmul (so called from
being inaccessible). This castle is made of crystal, and the
people fancy they can see it. They call it “Shell-battekōt”
or “Castle of Glass-stone.”</p>

<h4>1.—<span class="smcap">The Sportsman and the Castle of the Fairies.</span></h4>

<p>Once a sportsman ventured up the Nanga Parbat. To
his surprise he found no difficulty, and venturing farther
and farther, he at last reached the top. There he saw a
beautiful castle made of glass, and pushing one of the
doors he entered it, and found himself in a most magnificent
apartment. Through it he saw an open space that appeared
to be the garden of the castle, but there was in it only one
tree of excessive height, and which was entirely composed
of pearls and corals. The delighted sportsman filled his
sack in which he carried his corn, and left the place, hoping to
enrich himself by the sale of the pearls. As he was going
out of the door he saw an innumerable crowd of serpents
following him. In his agitation he shouldered the sack and
attempted to run, when a pearl fell out. It was eagerly
swallowed by a serpent which immediately disappeared.
The sportsman, glad to get rid of his pursuers at any
price, threw pearl after pearl to them, and in every case it
had the desired effect. At last, only one serpent remained,
but for her (a fairy in that shape?) he found no pearl; and
urged on by fear, he hastened to his village, Tarsing, which is
at the very foot of the Nanga Parbat. On entering his house,
he found it in great agitation; bread was being distributed
to the poor as they do at funerals, for his family had given
him up as lost. The serpent still followed and stopped at
the door. In despair, the man threw the corn-sack at her,
when lo! a pearl glided out. It was eagerly swallowed by
the serpent, which immediately disappeared. However, the
man was not the same being as before. He was ill for days,
and in about a fortnight after the events narrated, died, for
fairies never forgive a man who has surprised their secrets.</p>

<h4>2.—<span class="smcap">The Fairy who Punished her Human Lover.</span></h4>

<p>It is not believed in Astor that fairies ever marry human
beings, but in Gilgit there is a legend to that effect. A
famous sportsman, Kibá Lorí, who never returned empty-handed
from any excursion, kept company with a fairy to
whom he was deeply attached. Once in the hot weather
the fairy said to him not to go out shooting during “the
seven days of the summer,” “Caniculars,” which are called
“Bardá,” and are supposed to be the hottest days in
Dardistan. “I am,” said she, “obliged to leave you for
that period, and, mind, you do not follow me.” The
sportsman promised obedience and the fairy vanished,
saying that he would certainly die if he attempted to
follow her. Our love-intoxicated Nimrod, however, could
not endure her absence. On the fourth day he shouldered
his gun and went out with the hope of meeting her.
Crossing a range, he came upon a plain, where he saw an
immense gathering of game of all sorts and his beloved
fairy milking a “Kill” (markhor) and gathering the milk
into a silver vessel. The noise which Kibá Lorí made
caused the animal to start and to strike out with his legs,
which upset the silver vessel. The fairy looked up, and to
her anger beheld the disobedient lover. She went up to
him and, after reproaching him, struck him in the face.
But she had scarcely done so when despair mastered her
heart, and she cried out in the deepest anguish that “he
now must die within four days.” “However,” she said,
“do shoot one of these animals, so that people may not say
that you have returned empty-handed.” The poor man
returned crestfallen to his home, lay down, and died on the
fourth day.</p>

<h3 id="C_Wizards">C.—<span class="smcap">Dayall = Wizards and Witches.</span></h3>

<p>The gift of second sight, or rather the intercourse with
fairies, is confined to a few families in which it is hereditary.
The wizard is made to inhale the fumes of a fire which is
lit with the wood of the <i>tshili</i><a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> (Panjabi = Padam), a kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of fir-wood which gives much smoke. Into the fire the
milk of a white sheep or goat is poured. The wizard
inhales the smoke till he apparently becomes insensible.
He is then taken on the lap of one of the spectators, who
sings a song which restores him to his senses. In the
meanwhile, a goat is slaughtered, and the moment the
fortune-teller jumps up, its bleeding neck is presented to
him, which he sucks as long as a drop remains. The
assembled musicians then strike up a great noise, and the
wizard rushes about in the circle which is formed round
him and talks unintelligibly. The fairy then appears at
some distance and sings, which, however, only the wizard
hears. He then communicates her sayings in a song to
one of the musicians, who explains its meaning to the
people. The wizard is called upon to foretell events and
to give advice in cases of illness, etc. The people
believe that in ancient times these Dayalls invariably spoke
correctly, but that now scarcely one saying in a hundred
turns out to be true. Wizards do not now make a livelihood
by their talent, which is considered its own reward.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are few legends so exquisite as the one which
chronicles the origin, or rather the rise, of Gilgit. The
traditions regarding Alexander the Great, which Vigne and
others have imagined to exist among the people of Dardistan,
are unknown to, at any rate, the Shiná race, excepting
in so far as any Munshi accompanying the Maharajah’s troops
may, perhaps, accidentally have referred to them in conversation
with a Shîn. Any such information would have been
derived from the Sikandarnama of Nizámi, and would,
therefore, possess no original value. There exist no ruins,
as far as I have gone, to point to an occupation of Dardistan
by the soldiers of Alexander. The following legend,
however, which not only lives in the memories of all the
Shîn people, whether they be Chilasis, Astoris, Gilgitis,
or Brokhpá (the latter, as I discovered, living actually side
by side with the Baltis in Little Tibet), but which also an
annual festival commemorates, is not devoid of interest
from either a historical or a purely literary point of view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="D_Legend">D.—<span class="smcap">Historical Legend of the Origin of Gilgit.</span></h3>

<p>“Once upon a time there lived a race at Gilgit, whose
origin is uncertain. Whether they sprang from the soil, or
had immigrated from a distant region, is doubtful; so much
is believed, that they were Gayupí = spontaneous, aborigines,
unknown. Over them ruled a monarch who was a descendant
of the evil spirits, the Yatsh, that terrorized over the
world. His name was Shiribadatt, and he resided at a castle,
in front of which there was a course for the performance of
the manly game of Polo. (See my Hunza Nagyr Handbook.)
His tastes were capricious, and in every one of his
actions his fiendish origin could be discerned. The natives
bore his rule with resignation, for what could they effect
against a monarch at whose command even magic aids
were placed? However, the country was rendered fertile
and round the capital bloomed attractive gardens.</p>

<p>“The heavens, or rather the virtuous Peris, at last grew
tired of his tyranny, for he had crowned his iniquities by
indulging in a propensity for cannibalism. This taste had
been developed by an accident. One day his cook brought
him some mutton broth, the like of which he had never
tasted. After much inquiry as to the nature of the food on
which the sheep had been brought up, it was eventually
traced to an old woman, its first owner. She stated that
her child and the sheep were born on the same day, and
losing the former, she had consoled herself by suckling the
latter. This was a revelation to the tyrant. He had discovered
the secret of the palatability of the broth, and was
determined to have a never-ending supply of it. So he
ordered that his kitchen should be regularly provided with
children of tender age, whose flesh, when converted into
broth, would remind him of the exquisite dish he had once
so much relished. This cruel order was carried out. The
people of the country were dismayed at such a state of
things, and sought slightly to improve it by sacrificing, in
the first place, all orphans and children of neighbouring
tribes! The tyrant, however, was insatiable, and soon was
his cruelty felt by many families at Gilgit, who were
compelled to give up their children to slaughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“Relief came at last. At the top of the mountain Ko,
which it takes a day to ascend, and which overlooks the
village of Doyur, below Gilgit, on the side of the river,
appeared three figures. They looked like men, but much
more strong and handsome. In their arms they carried
bows and arrows, and turning their eyes in the direction of
Doyur, they perceived innumerable flocks of sheep and
cattle grazing on a prairie between that village and the
foot of the mountain. The strangers were fairies, and had
come (perhaps from Nagyr?) to this region with the view
of ridding Gilgit of the monster that ruled over it.
However, this intention was confined to the two elder
ones. The three strangers were brothers, and none of
them had been born at the same time. It was their intention
to make Azru Shemsher, the youngest, Rajah of
Gilgit, and, in order to achieve their purpose, they hit
upon the following plan.</p>

<p>“On the already-noticed plain, which is called Didingé,
a sportive calf was gamboling towards and away from its
mother. It was the pride of its owner, and its brilliant
red colour could be seen from a distance. ‘Let us see
who is the best marksman,’ exclaimed the eldest, and
saying this, he shot an arrow in the direction of the calf,
but missed his aim. The second brother also tried to hit
it, but also failed. At last, Azru Shemsher, who took a
deep interest in the sport, shot his arrow, which pierced
the poor animal from side to side and killed it. The
brothers, whilst descending, congratulated Azru on his
sportsmanship, and on arriving at the spot where the calf
was lying, proceeded to cut its throat, and to take out
from its body <i>the titbits, namely the kidneys and the liver</i>.</p>

<p>“They then roasted these delicacies, and invited Azru
to partake of them first. He respectfully declined, on the
ground of his youth; but they urged him to do so, ‘in
order,’ they said, ‘to reward you for such an excellent
shot.’ Scarcely had the meat touched the lips of Azru,
than the brothers got up, and vanishing into the air, called
out, ‘Brother! you have touched impure food, which Peris
never should eat, and we have made use of your ignorance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of this law, because we want to make you a human
being,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> who shall rule over Gilgit; remain therefore at
Doyur.’</p>

<p>“Azru in deep grief at the separation, cried, ‘Why
remain at Doyur, unless it be to grind corn?’ ‘Then,’
said the brothers, ‘go to Gilgit.’ ‘Why,’ was the reply,
‘go to Gilgit, unless it be to work in the gardens?’
‘No, no,’ was the last and consoling rejoinder; ‘you will
assuredly become the king of this country, and deliver it
from its merciless oppressor.’</p>

<p>“No more was heard of the departing fairies, and Azru
remained by himself, endeavouring to gather consolation
from the great mission which had been bestowed on him.
A villager met him, and, struck by his appearance, offered
him shelter in his house. Next morning he went on the
roof of his host’s house, and calling out to him to come up,
pointed to the Ko mountain, on which, he said, he plainly
discerned a wild goat. The incredulous villager began to
fear he had harboured a maniac, if no worse character;
but Azru shot off his arrow, and accompanied by the
villager (who had assembled some friends for protection,
as he was afraid his young guest might be an associate of
robbers, and lead him into a trap), went in the direction of
the mountain. There, to be sure, at the very spot that had
been pointed out, though many miles distant, was lying the
wild goat, with Azru’s arrow transfixing its body. The
astonished peasants at once hailed him as their leader, but
he exacted an oath of secrecy from them, for he had come
to deliver them from their tyrant, and would keep his incognito
till such time as his plans for the destruction of
the monster were matured.</p>

<p>“He then took leave of the hospitable people of Doyur,
and went to Gilgit. On reaching the place, which is
scarcely four miles distant from Doyur, he amused himself
by prowling about in the gardens adjoining the royal
residence. There he met one of the female companions of
Shiribadatt’s daughter (<i>goli</i> in Hill Punjabi, <i>Shadróy</i> in
Gilgiti) fetching water for the princess, a lady both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
remarkably handsome, and of a sweet disposition. The
companion rushed back, and told the young lady to look
from over the ramparts of the castle at a wonderfully handsome
young man whom she had just met. The princess
placed herself in a spot from which she could observe any
one approaching the fort. Her maid then returned, and
induced Azru to come with her on the Polo ground, the
“Shavaran,” in front of the castle; the princess was smitten
with his beauty and at once fell in love with him. She
then sent word to the young prince to come and see her.
When he was admitted into her presence, he for a long
time denied being anything else than a common labourer.
At last, he confessed to being a fairy’s child, and the overjoyed
princess offered him her heart and hand. It may be
mentioned here that the tyrant Shiribadatt had a wonderful
horse, which could cross a mile at every jump, and
which its rider had accustomed to jump both into and out
of the fort, over its walls. So regular were the leaps which
that famous animal could take, that he invariably alighted
at a distance of a mile from the fort and at the same place.</p>

<p>“On that very day on which the princess had admitted
young Azru into the fort, King Shiribadatt was out hunting,
of which he was desperately fond, and to which he used
sometimes to devote a week or two at a time. We must
now return to Azru, whom we left conversing with the
princess. Azru remained silent when the lady confessed
her love. Urged to declare his sentiments, he said that
he would not marry her unless she bound herself to him
by the most stringent oath; this she did, and <i>they became
in the sight of God as if they were wedded man and wife</i>.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
He then announced that he had come to destroy her father,
and asked her to kill him herself. This she refused; but
as she had sworn to aid him in every way she could, he
finally induced her to promise that she would ask her
father <i>where his soul was</i>. ‘Refuse food,’ said Azru, ‘for
three or four days, and your father, who is devotedly fond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of you will ask for the reason of your strange conduct;
then say, “Father, you are often staying away from me for
several days at a time, and I am getting distressed lest
something should happen to you; do reassure me by letting
me know where your soul is, and let me feel certain that
your life is safe.”’ This the princess promised to do, and
when her father returned refused food for several days.
The anxious Shiribadatt made inquiries, to which she
replied by making the already-named request. The tyrant
was for a few moments thrown into mute astonishment,
and finally refused compliance with her preposterous
demand. The love-smitten lady went on starving herself,
till at last her father, fearful for his daughter’s life, told her
not to fret herself about him, as <i>his soul was [of snow?] in
the snows</i>, and that he could only perish by fire. The
princess communicated this information to her lover.
Azru went back to Doyur and the villages around, and
assembled his faithful peasants. Them he asked to take
twigs of the fir-tree or <i>tshi</i>, bind them together and light
them—then to proceed in a body with the torches to the
castle in a circle, keep close together, and surround it on
every side. He then went and dug out a very deep hole,
as deep as a well, in the place where Shiribadatt’s horse
used to alight, and covered it with green boughs. The
next day he received information that the torches (<i>talên</i>
in Gilgiti and <i>Lome</i> in Astori) were ready. He at once
ordered the villagers gradually to draw near the fort in the
manner which he had already indicated.</p>

<p>“King Shiribadatt was then sitting in his castle; near
him his treacherous daughter, who was so soon to lose her
parent. All at once he exclaimed, ‘I feel very close; go out,
dearest, and see what has happened.’ The girl went out,
and saw torches approaching from a distance; but fancying
it to be something connected with the plans of her
husband, she went back, and said it was nothing. The
torches came nearer and nearer, and the tyrant became
exceedingly restless. ‘Air, air,’ he cried, ‘I feel very, very
ill; do see, daughter, what is the matter.’ The dutiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
lady went, and returned with the same answer as before.
At last, the torch-bearers had fairly surrounded the fort,
and Shiribadatt, with a presentiment of impending danger,
rushed out of the room, saying ‘that he felt he was dying.’
He then ran to the stables and mounted his favourite
charger, and with one blow of the whip made him jump
over the wall of the castle. Faithful to its habit, the noble
animal alighted at the same place, but alas! only to find
itself engulfed in a treacherous pit. Before the king had
time to extricate himself, the villagers had run up with their
torches. ‘Throw them upon him,’ cried Azru. With one
accord all the blazing wood was thrown upon Shiribadatt,
who miserably perished. Azru was then most enthusiastically
proclaimed king, celebrated his nuptials with the
fair traitor, <i>and, as sole tribute, exacted the offering of one
sheep, instead of that of a human child, annually from every
one of the natives</i>.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> This custom has prevailed down to
the present day, and the people of Shin, wherever they be,
celebrate their delivery from the rule of a monster, and the
inauguration of a more humane government, in the month
preceding the beginning of winter—a month which they
call Dawakió or Daykió—after the full moon is over and
the new moon has set in. The day of this national celebration
is called ‘nôs tshilí,’ ‘the feast of firs.’ The day
generally follows four or five days after the meat provision
for the winter has been laid in to dry. A few days of
rejoicing precede the special festivity, which takes place at
night. Then all the men of the villages go forth, having
torches in their hands, which, at the sound of music, they
swing round their heads, and throw in the direction of
Gilgit, if they are at any distance from that place; whilst
the people of Gilgit throw them indifferently about the plain
in which that town, if town it may be called, is situated.
When the throwing away of the brands is over, every man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
returns to his house, where a curious custom is observed.
He finds the door locked. The wife then asks: ‘Where
have you been all night? I won’t let you come in now.’
Then her husband entreats her and says, ‘I have brought
you property, and children, and happiness, and everything
you desire.’ Then, after some further parley, the door is
opened, and the husband walks in. He is, however,
stopped by a beam which goes across the room, whilst all
the females of the family rush into an inner apartment to
the eldest lady of the place. The man then assumes sulkiness
and refuses to advance, when the repenting wife
launches into the following song:—</p>

<p>During the Nauroz [evidently because it is not a

songs are sung. Eggs are dyed in different colours and
people go about amusing themselves by trying which eggs
are hardest by striking the end of one against the end of
another. The possessor of the hard egg wins the broken
one. The women, however, amuse themselves on those
days by tying ropes to trees and swinging themselves about
on them.</p>

<h4>HOW TO TREAT AN ENEMY.</h4>

<p><i>Dî dé, putsh kàh</i> = “give the daughter and eat the son,”
is a Gilgit proverb with regard to how one ought to treat
an enemy. The recommendation given is: “marry your
daughter to your foe and then kill him,” [by which you get
a male’s head which is more valuable than that of a female.]
The Dards have sometimes acted on this maxim in order
to lull the suspicions of their Kashmir enemies.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<h4>21. THE FROG IN A DILEMMA.</h4>

<p>“If I speak, the water will rush against my mouth, and if

<p>This was said by a frog who was in the water and angry
at something that occurred. If he croaked, he would be
drowned by the water rushing down his throat, and if he
did not croak he would burst with suppressed rage. This
saying is often referred to by women when they are angry
with their husbands, who may, perhaps, beat them if they
say anything. A frog is called “manok.”</p>

<h4>22. THE FOX AND THE UNIVERSE.</h4>

<p>When a man threatens a lot of people with impossible
menaces, the reply often is “Don’t act like the fox ‘Lóyn’
who was carried away by the water.” A fox one day fell
into a river: as he swept past the shore he cried out, “The
water is carrying off the universe.” The people on the
banks of the river said, “We can only see a fox whom the
river is drifting down.”</p>

<p>“The fox wanted to eat pomegranates: as he could not
reach them, he went to a distance and <i>biting his lips</i> [as
“tshàmm” was explained by an Astori although Gilgitis
call it “tshappé,”] spat on the ground, saying, they are too
sour.” I venture to consider the conduct of this fox more
cunning than the one of “sour grapes” memory. His
biting his lips and, in consequence, spitting on the ground,
would make his disappointed face really look as if he had
tasted something sour.</p>

<h3>THE GILGIT QUEEN AND THE MOGULS.<br />
1. GILGITI SONG.</h3>

<p>Once upon a time a Mogul army came down and surrounded
the fort of Gilgit. At that time Gilgit was governed
by a woman, Mirzéy Juwāri<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> by name. She was the widow
of a Rajah supposed to have been of Balti descent. The
Lady seeing herself surrounded by enemies sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse indent2">Nikāto = has risen</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The meaning of this, according to my Gilgiti informant,
is: Juwari laments that “I, the daughter of a brave King,
am only a woman, a cup of pleasures, exposed to dangers
from any one who wishes to sip from it. To my misfortune,
my prominent position has brought me enemies. Oh, my
dear son, for whom I would sacrifice myself, I have sacrificed
you! Instead of preserving the Government for you, the
morning-star which shines on its destruction has now risen
on you.”</p>

fate, as the danger has <i>not</i> passed, since the village Doloja
yet remains to be conquered.”</p>

<p>Shammi Shah Shaíthing was one of the founders of the
Shín rule. His wife, although she sees her husband surrounded
by women anxious to gain his good graces, rests
secure in the knowledge of his affections belonging to her
and of her being the mother of his children. She, therefore,
ridicules the pretensions of her rivals, who, she fancies, will,
at the utmost, only have a temporary success. In the above
still preserved song she says, with a serene confidence, not
shared by <i>Indian</i> wives.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Translation.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Translation of “A Woman’s Song.”</i></p>

<p><i>The deserted wife sings</i>:—My Pathan! oh kukúri, far
away from me has he made a home; but, aunt, what am I
to do, since he has left his own! The silk that I have been
weaving during his absence would be sufficient to bind all
the animals of the field. Oh, how my darling is delaying
his return!</p>

<p><i>The faithless husband sings</i>:—[My new love] Azari is
like a royal Deodar; is it not so, my love? for Azari I am
sick with desire. She is a Wazeer’s princess; is it not so,
my love? Let me put you in my waist. The sun on
yonder mountain, and the tree on this nigh mountain, ye
both I love dearly. I will recline when this white hawk
and her black fragrant tresses become mine; encircling
with them my head I will recline [in happiness.]</p>

<h3>8. GURAIZI SONGS.</h3>

<p>This district used to be under Ahmad Shah of Skardo,
and has since its conquest by Ghulab Singh come permanently
under the Maharajah of Kashmîr. Its possession
used to be the apple of discord between the Nawabs of
Astor and the Rajahs of Skardo. It appears never to have
had a real Government of its own. The fertility of its
valleys always invited invasion. Yet the people are of
Shîná origin and appear much more manly than the other
subjects of Kashmîr. Their loyalty to that power is not
much to be relied upon, but it is probable that with the
great intermixture which has taken place between them
and the Kashmîri Mussulmans for many years past, they
will become equally demoralized. The old territory of
Guraiz used in former days to extend up to Kuyam or
Bandipur on the Wular Lake. The women are reputed to
be very chaste, and Colonel Gardiner told me that the
handsomest women in Kashmîr came from that district.
To me, however, they appeared to be tolerably plain,
although rather innocent-looking, which may render them
attractive, especially after one has seen the handsome, but
sensual-looking, women of Kashmîr. The people of Guraiz
are certainly very dirty, but they are not so plain as the
Chilásis. At Guraiz three languages are spoken: Kashmîri,
Guraizi (a corruption of a Shiná dialect), and Panjabi—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
latter on account of its occupation by the Maharajah’s
officials. I found some difficulty in getting a
number of them together from the different villages which
compose the district of Guraiz, the Arcadia of Kashmir,
but I gave them food and money, and after I got them into
a good humour they sang:</p>

<p>This is apparently a hunting song, but seems also to be
applied to singing the praises of a favourite.</p>

<p>There is another song, which was evidently given with
great gusto, in praise of Sheir Shah Ali Shah, Rajah of
Skardo.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> That Rajah, who is said to have temporarily
conquered Chitrál, which the Chilasis call Tshatshál,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> made
a road of steps up the Atsho mountain which overlooks
Bûnji, the most distant point reached before 1866 by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
travellers or the Great Trigonometrical Survey. From the
Atsho mountain Vigne returned, “the suspicious Rajah of
Gilgit suddenly giving orders for burning the bridge over
the Indus.” It is, however, more probable that his Astori
companions fabricated the story in order to prevent him
from entering an unfriendly territory in which Mr. Vigne’s
life might have been in danger, for had he reached Bûnji
he might have known that the Indus never was spanned by
a bridge at that or any neighbouring point. The miserable
Kashmîri coolies and boatmen who were forced to go up-country
with the troops in 1866 were, some of them,
employed, in rowing people across, and that is how I got
over the Indus at Bûnji; however to return from this digression
to the <i>Guraizi Song</i>:</p>

<p>I believe there was much more of this historical song,
but unfortunately the paper on which the rest was written
down by me as it was delivered, has been lost together
with other papers.</p>

<p>“Tshamūgar,” to which reference is made in the song, is
a village on the other side of the Gilgit river on the Nagyr
side. It is right opposite to where I stayed for two nights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
under a huge stone which projects from the base of the
Niludâr range on the Gilgit side.</p>

<p>There were formerly seven forts at Tshamūgar. A convention
had been made between the Rajah of Gilgit and
the Rajah of Skardo, by which Tshamūgar was divided by
the two according to the natural division which a stream
that comes down from the Batkôr mountain made in that
territory. The people of Tshamūgar, impatient of the
Skardo rule, became all of them subjects to the Gilgit
Rajah, on which Sher Shah Ali Shah, the ruler of Skardo,
collected an army, and crossing the Makpon-i-shagaron<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
at the foot of the Haramûsh mountain, came upon Tshamūgar
and diverted the water which ran through that district
into another direction. This was the reason of the
once fertile Tshamūgar becoming deserted; the forts were
razed to the ground. There are evidently traces of a river
having formerly run through Tshamūgar. The people say
that the Skardo Rajah stopped the flow of the water by
throwing quicksilver into it. This is probably a legend
arising from the reputation which Ahmad Shah, the most
recent Skardo ruler whom the Guraizis can remember, had
of dabbling in medicine and sorcery.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<h3>A PRAYER OF THE BASHGELI KAFIRS.<br />
[<i>In the Kalásha dialect.</i>]</h3>

<p>The ideas and many of the words in this prayer were
evidently acquired by my two Kafirs on their way through
Kashmir:</p>

<p>“Khudá, tandrusti dé, prushkári rozì de, abattì kari,
dewalat man. Tu ghóna asas, tshik intara, tshik tu faidá
káy asas. Sat asmán tì, Stru suri mastruk mótshe dé.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="MANNERS_AND_CUSTOMS"><i>MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.</i></h2>

<h3 id="heading_a">A. AMUSEMENTS.</h3>

<p>The Chaughan Bazi or Hockey on horseback, so popular
everywhere north of Kashmir, and which is called Polo by
the Baltis and Ladakis, who both play it to perfection and
in a manner which I shall describe elsewhere, is also well
known to the Ghilgiti and Astori subdivisions of the
Shina people. On great general holidays as well as on
any special occasion of rejoicing, the people meet on those
grounds which are mostly near the larger villages, and
pursue the game with great excitement and at the risk of
casualties. The first day I was at Astor, I had the greatest
difficulty in restoring to his senses a youth of the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Rustem Ali who, like a famous player of the same name at
Mardo, was passionately fond of the game, and had been
thrown from his horse. The place of meeting near Astor
is called the Eedgah. The game is called <span class="smcap">Tope</span> in Astor,
and the grounds for playing it are called <span class="smcap">Shajaran</span>. At
Gilgit the game is called <span class="smcap">Bulla</span>, and the place <span class="smcap">Shawaran</span>.
The latter names are evidently of Tibetan origin.</p>

<p>The people are also very fond of target practice, shooting
with bows, which they use dexterously but in which they
do not excel the people of Nagyr and Hunza. Game is
much stalked during the winter. At Astor any game shot
on the three principal hills—<i>Tshhamô</i>, a high hill opposite
the fort, <i>Demídeldèn</i> and <i>Tshólokot</i>—belong to the Nawab
of Astor—the sportsman receiving only the head, legs and
a haunch—or to his representative, then the Tahsildar
Munshi Rozi Khan. At Gilgit everybody claims what he
may have shot, but it is customary for the Nawab to
receive some share of it. Men are especially appointed to
watch and track game, and when they discover their whereabouts
notice is sent to the villages from which parties
issue, accompanied by musicians, and surround the game.
Early in the morning, when the “Lóhe” dawns, the
musicians begin to play and a great noise is made which
frightens the game into the several directions where the
sportsmen are placed.</p>

<p>The guns are matchlocks and are called in Gilgiti
“<i>turmàk</i>” and in Astór “tumák.” At Gilgit they manufacture
the guns themselves or receive them from Badakhshan.
The balls have only a slight coating of lead, the
inside generally being a little stone. The people of Hunza
and Nagyr invariably place their guns on little wooden
pegs which are permanently fixed to the gun and are called
“Dugazá.” The guns are much lighter than those manufactured
elsewhere, much shorter and carry much smaller
bullets than the matchlock of the Maharajah’s troops. They
carry very much farther than any native Indian gun and
are fired with almost unerring accuracy. For “small shot”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
little stones of any shape—the longest and oval ones being
preferred—are used. There is one kind of stone especially
which is much used for that purpose; it is called “Balósh
Batt,” which is found in Hanza, Nagyr, Skardo, and near
the “Demídeldèn” hill already noticed, at a village called
Pareshinghi near Astor. It is a very soft stone and large
cooking utensils are cut out from it, whence the name,
“Balósh” Kettle, “Batt” stone, “Balósh Batt.” The
stone is cut out with a chisel and hammer; the former is
called “Gútt” in Astori and “Gukk” in Gilgiti; the
hammer “toá” and “Totshúng” and in Gilgiti “samdenn.”
The gunpowder is manufactured by the people
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The people also play at backgammon, [called in Astóri
“Patshis,” and “<span class="smcap">Takk</span>” in Gilgiti,] with dice [called in
Astóri and also in Gilgiti “dall.”]</p>

<p>Fighting with iron wristbands is confined to Chilasi
women who bring them over their fists which they are
said to use with effect.</p>

<p>The people are also fond of wrestling, of butting each
other whilst hopping, etc.</p>

<p>To play the Jew’s harp is considered meritorious as
King David played it. All other music good Mussulmans
are bid to avoid.</p>

<p>The “Sitara” [the Eastern Guitar] used to be much
played in Yassen, the people of which country as well as
the people of Hunza and Nagyr excel in dancing, singing
and playing. After them come the Gilgitis, then the
Astoris, Chilasis, Baltis, etc. The people of Nagyr are a
comparatively mild race. They carry on goldwashing
which is constantly interrupted by kidnapping parties from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the opposite Hunza. The language of Nagyr and Hunza
is the Non-Aryan Khajuná and no affinity between that
language and any other has yet been traced. The Nagyris
are mostly Shiahs. They are short and stout and fairer
than the people of Hunza [the Kunjûtis] who are described<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
as “tall skeletons” and who are desperate robbers. The
Nagyris understand Tibetan, Persian and Hindustani.
Badakhshan merchants were the only ones who could travel
with perfect safety through Yassen, Chitral and Hunza.</p>

<h4>DANCES<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></h4>

<p>Fall into two main divisions: “slow” or “Búti Harip”
= Slow Instrument and Quick “Danni Harip,” = Quick
Instrument. The Yassen, Nagyr and Hunza people dance
quickest; then come the Gilgitis; then the Astóris; then
the Baltis, and slowest of all are the Ladakis.</p>

<p>When all join in the dance, cheer or sing with gesticulations,
the dance or recitative is called “thapnatt” in
Gilgiti, and “Burró” in Astóri.</p>

<p>When there is a solo dance it is called “nàtt” in
Gilgiti, and “nott” in Astóri.</p>

<p>“Cheering” is called “Halamush” in Ghilgiti, and
“Halamùsh” in Astóri. Clapping of hands is called
“tza.” Cries of “<i>Yú</i>, Yú dea; tza theá, Hiú Hiú dea;
Halamush thea; shabâsh” accompany the performances.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Dances. The <span class="smcap">Prasulki nate</span>,
is danced by ten or twelve people ranging themselves
behind the bride as soon as she reaches the bridegroom’s
house. This custom is observed at Astor. In this dance
men swing above sticks or whatever they may happen to
hold in their hands.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus4">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="700" height="480" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Dance at Gilgit (Dr.
Leitner and his Panjabi Attendants looking on).</span></p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Buró natt</span> is a dance performed on the Nao holiday,
in which both men and women engage—the women
forming a ring round the central group of dancers, which
is composed of men. This dance is called <span class="smcap">Thappnatt</span> at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Gilgit. In Dareyl there is a dance in which the dancers
wield swords and engage in a mimic fight. This dance
Gilgitis and Astòris call the <i>Darelâ nat</i>, but what it is
called by the Dareylis themselves I do not know.</p>

<p>The mantle dance is called “<span class="smcap">Goja nat</span>.” In this
popular dance the dancer throws his cloth over his extended
arm.</p>

<p>When I sent a man round with a drum inviting all the
Dards that were to be found at Gilgit to a festival, a large
number of men appeared, much to the surprise of the invading
Dogras, who thought that they had all run to the
hills. A few sheep were roasted for their benefit; bread
and fruit were also given them, and when I thought they
were getting into a good humour, I proposed that they
should sing. Musicians had been procured with great
difficulty, and after some demur, the Gilgitis sang and
danced. At first, only one at a time danced, taking his
sleeves well over his arm so as to let it fall over, and then
moving it up and down according to the cadence of the
music. The movements were, at first, slow, one hand
hanging down, the other being extended with a commanding
gesture. The left foot appeared to be principally
engaged in moving or rather jerking the body forward.
All sorts of “pas seuls” were danced; sometimes a rude
imitation of the Indian Nátsh; the by-standers clapping
their hands and crying out “Shabâsh”; one man, a sort of
Master of Ceremonies, used to run in and out amongst
them, brandishing a stick, with which, in spite of his very
violent gestures, he only lightly touched the bystanders,
and exciting them to cheering by repeated calls, which the
rest then took up, of “Hiù, Hiù.” The most extraordinary
dance, however, was when about twelve men arose to
dance, of whom six went on one side and six on the other,
both sides then, moving forward, jerked out their arms so
as to look as if they had all crossed swords, then receded
and let their arms drop. This was a war dance, and I was
told that properly it ought to have been danced with
swords, which, however, out of suspicion of the Dogras,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
did not seem to be forthcoming. They then formed a
circle, again separated, the movements becoming more and
more violent till almost all the bystanders joined in the
dance, shouting like fiends and literally <i>kicking</i> up a frightful
amount of dust, which, after I had nearly become
choked with it, compelled me to retire.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> I may also notice
that before a song is sung the rhythm and melody of it are
given in “solo” by some one, for instance</p>

<h3 id="heading_b">B. BEVERAGES.</h3>

<h4>BEER.</h4>

<p>Fine corn (about five or six <i>seers</i> in weight) is put into a
kettle with water and boiled till it gets soft, but not pulpy.
It is then strained through a cloth, and the grain retained and
put into a vessel. Then it is mixed with a drug that comes
from Ladak which is called “Papps,” and has a salty taste,
but in my opinion is nothing more than hardened dough with
which some kind of drug is mixed. It is necessary that “the
marks of four fingers” be impressed upon the “Papps.” The
mark of “four fingers” make one stick, 2 fingers’ mark ½ a
stick, and so forth. This is scraped and mixed with the corn.
The whole is then put into an earthen jar with a narrow
neck, after it has received an infusion of an amount of water
equal to the proportion of corn. The jar is put out into
the sun—if summer—for twelve days, or under the fire-place—if
in winter—[where a separate vault is made for it]—for
the same period. The orifice is almost hermetically
closed with a skin. After twelve days the jar is opened
and contains a drink possessing intoxicating qualities. The
first infusion is much prized, but the corn receives a second
and sometimes even a third supply of water, to be put out
again in a similar manner and to provide a kind of Beer for
the consumer. This Beer is called “Mō,” and is much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
drunk by the Astóris and Chilasis [the latter are rather
stricter Mussulmans than the other Shiná people]. After
every strength has been taken out of the corn it is given
away as food to sheep, etc., which they find exceedingly
nourishing.</p>

<h4>WINE.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></h4>

<p>The Gilgitis are great wine-drinkers, though not so
much as the people of Hunza. In Nagyr little wine is
made. The mode of the preparation of the wine is a simple
one. The grapes are stamped out by a man who, fortunately
before entering into the wine press, washes his feet
and hands. The juice flows into another reservoir, which
is first well laid round with stones, over which a cement is
put of chalk mixed with sheep-fat which is previously
heated. The juice is kept in this reservoir; the top is
closed, cement being put round the sides and only in the
middle an opening is made over which a loose stone is
placed. After two or three months the reservoir is opened,
and the wine is used at meals and festivals. In Dareyl
(and not in Gilgit, as was told to Vigne,) the custom is
to sit round the grave of the deceased and eat grapes, nuts
and Tshilgōzas (edible pine). In Astor (and in Chilâs?)
the custom is to put a number of Ghi (clarified butter) cakes
before the Mulla, [after the earth has been put on the
deceased] who, after reading prayers over them, distributes
them to the company who are standing round with their
caps on. In Gilgit, three days after the burial, bread is
generally distributed to the friends and acquaintances of the
deceased. To return to the wine presses, it is to be
noticed that no one ever interferes with the store of
another. I passed several of them on my road from
Tshakerkōt onward, but they appeared to have been
destroyed. This brings me to another custom which all
the Dards seem to have of burying provisions of every kind
in cellars that are scooped out in the mountains or near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
their houses, and of which they alone have any knowledge.
The Maharajah’s troops when invading Gilgit often
suffered severely from want of food when, unknown to
them, large stores of grain of every kind, butter, ghi, etc.,
were buried close to them. The Gilgitis and other so-called
rebels, generally, were well off, knowing where to go
for food. Even in subject Astor it is the custom to lay up
provisions in this manner. On the day of birth of anyone
in that country it is the custom to bury a stock of provisions
which are opened on the day of betrothal of the
young man and distributed. The ghi, which by that time
turns frightfully sour, and [to our taste] unpalatable and the
colour of which is red, is esteemed a great delicacy and is
said to bring much luck.</p>

<p>The chalk used for cementing the stones is called “San
Bàtt.” Grapes are called “Djatsh,” and are said, together
with wine, to have been the principal food of Ghazanfar,
the Rajah of Hunza, of whom it is reported that when he
heard of the arrival of the first European in Astor (probably
Vigne) he fled to a fort called Gojal and shut himself
up in it with his flocks, family and retainers. He had been
told that the European was a great sorcerer, who carried
an army with him in his trunks and who had serpents
at his command that stretched themselves over any
river in his way to afford him a passage. I found this
reputation of European sorcery of great use, and the wild
mountaineers looked with respect and awe on a little box
which I carried with me, and which contained some pictures
of clowns and soldiers belonging to a small magic lantern.
The Gilgitis consider the use of wine as unlawful; probably
it is not very long since they have become so
religious and drink it with remorse. My Gilgitis told me
that the Mughullí—a sect living in Hunza, Gojal, Yassen and
Punyal<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>—considered the use of wine with prayers to be rather
meritorious than otherwise. A Drunkard is called “Máto.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading_c">C. BIRTH CEREMONIES.</h3>

<p>As soon as the child is born the father or the Mulla repeats
the “Bâng” in his ear “Allah Akbar” (which an Astóri, of
the name of Mirza Khan, said was never again repeated in
one’s life!). Three days after the reading of the “Bâng”
or “Namáz” in Gilgit and seven days after that ceremony
in Astor, a large company assembles in which the father or
grandfather of the newborn gives him a name or the Mulla
fixes on a name by putting his hand on some word in the
Koran, which may serve the purpose or by getting somebody
else to fix his hand at random on a passage or word
in the Koran. Men and women assemble at that meeting.
There appears to be no pardah whatsoever in Dardu land,
and the women are remarkably chaste.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The little imitation
of pardah amongst the Ranis of Gilgit was a mere fashion
imported from elsewhere. Till the child receives a name
the woman is declared impure for the seven days previous
to the ceremony. In Gilgit 27 days are allowed to elapse
till the woman is declared pure. Then the bed and clothes
are washed and the woman is restored to the company of
her husband and the visits of her friends. Men and women
eat together everywhere in Dardu land. In Astór, raw milk
alone cannot be drunk together with a woman unless thereby
it is intended that she should be a sister by faith and come
within the prohibited degrees of relationship. When men
drink of the same raw milk they thereby swear each other
eternal friendship. In Gilgit this custom does not exist, but
it will at once be perceived that much of what has been noted
above belongs to Mussulman custom generally. When a son
is born great rejoicings take place, and in Gilgit a musket
is fired off by the father whilst the “Bâng” is being read.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading_d">D. MARRIAGE.</h3>

<p>In Gilgit it appears to be a more simple ceremony than
in Chilâs and Astór. The father of the boy goes to the
father of the girl and presents him with a knife about 1½ feet
long, 4 yards of cloth and a pumpkin filled with wine. If
the father accepts the present the betrothal is arranged. It
is generally the fashion that after the betrothal, which is
named: “<i>Shéir qatar wíye, ballí píye</i>, = 4 yards of cloth
and a knife he has given, the pumpkin he has drunk,” the
marriage takes place. A betrothal is inviolable, and is only
dissolved by death so far as the woman is concerned. The
young man is at liberty to dissolve the contract. When
the marriage day arrives the men and women who are
acquainted with the parties range themselves in rows at the
house of the bride, the bridegroom with her at his left
sitting together at the end of the row. The Mulla then
reads the prayers, the ceremony is completed and the playing,
dancing and drinking begin. It is considered the
proper thing for the bridegroom’s father, if he belongs to
the true Shín race, to pay 12 tolas of gold of the value [at
Gilgit] of 15 Rupees Nanakshahi (10 annas each) to the
bride’s father, who, however, generally, returns it with the
bride, in kind—dresses, ornaments, &amp;c., &amp;c. The 12 tolas
are not always, or even generally, taken in gold, but oftener
in kind—clothes, provisions and ornaments. At Astór the
ceremony seems to be a little more complicated. There
the arrangements are managed by third parties; an agent
being appointed on either side. The father of the young
man sends a present of a needle and three real (red)
“múngs” called “lújum” in Chilâsi, which, if accepted,
establishes the betrothal of the parties. Then the father of
the bride demands <i>pro formâ</i> 12 tolas [which in Astór and
Chilâs are worth 24 Rupees of the value of ten annas each.]</p>

<p>All real “Shín” people must pay this dowry for their
wives in money, provisions or in the clothes which the
bride’s father may require. The marriage takes place when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the girl reaches puberty, or perhaps rather the age when
she is considered fit to be married. It may be mentioned
here in general terms that those features in the ceremony
which remind one of Indian customs are undoubtedly of
Indian origin introduced into the country since the occupation
of Astór by the Maharaja’s troops. Gilgit which is further off
is less subject to such influences, and whatever it may have of
civilization is indigenous or more so than is the case at Astór,
the roughness of whose manners is truly Chilâsi, whilst its
apparent refinement in some things is a foreign importation.</p>

<p>When the marriage ceremony commences the young
man, accompanied by twelve of his friends and by
musicians, sits in front of the girl’s house. The
mother of the girl brings out bread and Ghi-cakes on
plates, which she places before the bridegroom, round whom
she goes three times, caressing him and finally kissing his
hand. The bridegroom then sends her back with a present
of a few rupees or tolas in the emptied plates. Then, after
some time, as the evening draws on, the agent of the father
of the boy sends to say that it is time that the ceremony
should commence. The mother of the bride then stands
in the doorway of her house with a few other platefuls of
cakes and bread, and the young man accompanied by his
bridesman [“Shunèrr” in Astóri and “Shamaderr” in
Gilgiti,] enters the house. At his approach, the girl, who
also has her particular friend, the “Shaneróy” in Astóri,
and “Shamaderoy” in Gilgiti, rises. The boy is seated
at her right, but both in Astór and in Gilgit it is considered
indecent for the boy to turn round and look at her.
Then a particular friend, the “Dharm-bhai”<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> of the girl’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
brother asks her if she consents to the marriage. In receiving,
or imagining, an affirmative, he turns round to the
Mulla, who after asking three times whether he, she and
the bridegroom as well as all present are satisfied, reads the
prayers and completes the ceremonial. Then some rice,
boiled in milk, is brought in, of which the boy and the girl
take a spoonful. They do not retire the first night, but grace
the company with their presence. The people assembled
then amuse themselves by hearing the musicians, eating, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It appears to be the custom that a person leaves an
entertainment whenever he likes, which is generally the
case after he has eaten enough.</p>

<p>It must, however, not be imagined that the sexes are
secluded from each other in Dardistan. Young people
have continual opportunities of meeting each other in the
fields at their work or at festive gatherings. Love declarations
often take place on these occasions, but if any evil
intention is perceived the seducer of a girl is punished by
this savage, but virtuous, race with death. The Dards
know and speak of the existence of “pure love,” “pâk
âshiqi.” Their love songs show sufficiently that they are
capable of a deeper, than mere sexual, feeling. No objection
to lawful love terminating in matrimony is ever made
unless the girl or the boy is of a lower caste. In Gilgit,
however, the girl may be of a lower caste than the bridegroom.
In Astór it appears that a young man, whose
parents—to whom he must mention his desire for marrying
any particular person—refuse to intercede, often attains his
point by threatening to live in the family of the bride and
become an adopted son. A “Shîn” of true race at Astor
may live in concubinage with a girl of lower caste, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
relatives of the girl if they discover the intrigue revenge
the insult by murdering the paramour, who, however, does
not lose caste by the alliance.</p>

<p>The bridegroom dances as well as his twelve companions.
The girl ought not to be older than 15 years; but at 12
girls are generally engaged.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The Balti custom of having merely a <i>claim to dowry</i> on
the part of the woman—the prosecution of which claim so
often depends on her satisfaction with her husband or the
rapacity of her relatives—is in spite of the intercourse of
the Baltis with the Shîn people never observed by the
latter; not even by the Shîn colonists of little Tibet who
are called “Brokhpá.”</p>

<p>When the bridegroom has to go for his bride to a distant
village he is furnished with a bow. On arriving at his
native place he crosses the breast of his bride with an
arrow and then shoots it off. He generally shoots three
arrows off in the direction of his home.</p>

<p>At Astór the custom is sometimes to fire guns as a sign
of rejoicing. This is not done at Gilgit.</p>

<p>When the bridegroom fetches his bride on the second
day to his own home, the girl is crying with the women of
her household and the young man catches hold of her dress
in front (at Gilgit by the hand) and leads her to the door.
If the girl cannot get over embracing her people and crying
with them quickly, the twelve men who have come along
with the bridegroom (who in Astóri are called “hilalée” =
bridegrooms and “garóni” in Gilgiti) sing the following
song:—</p>

<h3 id="heading_e">E. FUNERALS.</h3>

<p>Funerals are conducted in a very simple manner. The
custom of eating grapes at funerals I have already touched
upon in my allusion to Dureyl in the chapter on “Wine.”
Bread is commonly distributed together with Ghî, etc., three
days after the funeral, to people in general, a custom which
is called “Nashí” by the Astóris, and “Khatm” by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Gilgitis. When a person is dead, the Mulla, assisted
generally by a near friend of the deceased, washes the body
which is then placed in a shroud. Women assemble, weep
and relate the virtues of the deceased. The body is conveyed
to the grave the very day of the decease. In Astor
there is something in the shape of a bier for conveying the
dead. At Gilgit two poles, across which little bits of
wood are placed sideways and then fastened, serve for the
same purpose. The persons who carry the body think it a
meritorious act. The women accompany the body for some
fifty yards and then return to the house to weep. The
body is then placed in the earth which has been dug up
to admit of its interment. Sometimes the grave is well-cemented
and a kind of small vault is made over it with
pieces of wood closely jammed together. A Pîr or saint
receives a hewn stone standing as a sign-post from the
tomb. I have seen no inscriptions anywhere. The tomb
of one of their famous saints at Gilgit has none. I have
heard people there say that he was killed at that place in
order to provide the country with a shrine. My Gilgiti
who, like all his countrymen, was very patriotic, denied it,
but I heard it at Gilgit from several persons, among
whom was one of the descendants of the saint. As the
Saint was a Kashmiri, the veracity of his descendant may
be doubted. To return to the funeral. The body is conveyed
to the cemetery, which is generally at some distance
from the village, accompanied by friends. When they
reach the spot the Mulla reads the prayers standing as in
the “Djenazá”—any genuflexion, “ruku” ‎‏رکوع‏‎and prostration
are, of course, inadmissible. After the body has been
interred the Mulla recites the Fatiha, [opening prayer of
the Koran] all people standing up and holding out their
hands as if they were reading a book. The Mulla prays
that the deceased may be preserved from the fire of hell as
he was a good man, etc. Then after a short benediction
the people separate. For three days at Gilgit and seven
days at Astor the near relatives of the deceased do not eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
meat. After that period the grave is again visited by the
deceased’s friends, who, on reaching the grave, eat some
ghí and bread, offer up prayers, and, on returning, slaughter
a sheep, whose kidney is roasted and divided in small bits
amongst those present. Bread is distributed amongst those
present and a little feast is indulged in, in memory of the
deceased. I doubt, however, whether the Gilgitis are
very exact in their religious exercises. The mention of
death was always received with shouts of laughter by them,
and one of them told me that a dead person deserved only
to be kicked. He possibly only joked and there can be
little doubt that the Gilgit people are not very communicative
about their better feelings. It would be ridiculous,
however, to deny them the possession of natural feelings,
although I certainly believe that they are not over-burdened
with sentiment. In Astór the influence of Kashmir has
made the people attend a little more to the ceremonies of the
Mussulman religion.</p>

<p>In Chilâs rigour is observed in the maintenance of
religious practices, but elsewhere there exists the greatest
laxity. In fact, so rude are the people that they have no
written character of their own, and till very recently the
art of writing (Persian) was confined to, perhaps, the Rajas
of these countries or rather to their Munshis, whenever
they had any. Some of them may be able to read the
Koran. Even this I doubt, as of hundreds of people I saw
only one who could read at Gilgit, and he was a Kashmiri
who had travelled far and wide and had at last settled in
that country.</p>

<h3 id="heading_f">F. HOLIDAYS.</h3>

<p>The great holiday of the Shîn people happened in 1867,
during the month succeeding the Ramazan, but seems to
be generally on the sixth of February. It is called the
“Shinó náo,” “the new day of the Shîn people.” The
Gilgitis call the day “Shinó bazóno,” “the spring of the
Shîn people.” [The year, it will be remembered, is divided
into bazono = spring; walo = summer; shero = autumn;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
yono = winter.] The snow is now becoming a little softer
and out-of-door life is more possible. The festivities are
kept up for twelve days. Visits take place and man and
wife are invited out to dinner during that period. Formerly,
when the Shîns had a Raja or Nawab of their own, it used
to be the custom for women to dance during those twelve
days. Now the advent of the Sepoys and the ridiculous
pseudo-morality of the Kashmir rule have introduced a
kind of Pardah and the chaste Shîn women do not like to
expose themselves to the strangers. Then there is the Naurôz,
which is celebrated for three, and sometimes for six, days.</p>

<p>There are now five great holidays in the year:</p>

<ul>
<li>The I’d of Ramazân.</li>
<li>The Shinó-Náo.</li>
<li>The Naurôz.</li>
<li>Kurbanī I’d.</li>
<li>The Kùy Náo,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> { Astóri.</li>
<li>Dúmniká,         { Gilgiti.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the last-named holiday the game of Polo is played,
good clothes are put on, and men and women amuse themselves
at public meetings.</p>

<p>The Shîn people are very patriotic. Since the Maharaja’s
rule many of their old customs have died out, and the separation
of the sexes is becoming greater. Their great
national festival I have already described under the head
of “Historical Legend of Gilgit” (<a href="#D_Legend">pages 14 to 16</a>).</p>

<h3 id="heading_g">G. THE RELIGIOUS IDEAS OF THE DARDS.</h3>

<p>If the Dards—the races living between the Hindu-Kush
and Kaghán—have preserved many Aryan customs and
traditions, it is partly because they have lived in almost
perfect seclusion from other Muhammadans. In Chilâs,
where the Sunni form of that faith prevails, there is little
to relieve the austerity of that creed. The rest of the
Muhammadan Dards are Shiahs, and that belief is more
elastic and seems to be more suited to a quick-witted race,
than the orthodox form of Islam. Sunniism, however, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
advancing in Dardistan and will, no doubt, sweep away
many of the existing traditions. The progress, too, of the
present invasion by Kashmir, which, although governed by
Hindus, is chiefly Sunni, will familiarize the Dards with
the notions of orthodox Muhammadans and will tend to
substitute a monotonous worship for a multiform superstition.
I have already noticed that, in spite of the exclusiveness
of Hinduism, attempts are made by the Maharaja of
Kashmir to gather into the fold those races and creeds
which, merely because they are not Muhammadan, are
induced by him to consider themselves Hindu. For instance,
the Siah Posh Kafirs, whom I venture also to consider
Dards, have an ancient form of nature-worship which
is being encroached upon by Hindu myths, not because
they are altogether congenial but because they constitute
the religion of the enemies of Muhammadans, their own
bitter foes who kidnap the pretty Kafir girls and to kill
whom establishes a claim among Kafirs to consideration.
In the same way there is a revival of Hinduism in the
Buddhist countries of Ladak and Zanskar, which belong to
Kashmir, and ideas of caste are welcomed where a few
years ago they were unknown. As no one can become a
Hindu, but any one can become a Muhammadan, Hinduism
is at a natural disadvantage in its contact with an advancing
creed and, therefore, there is the more reason why zealous
Hindus should seek to strengthen themselves by amalgamation
with other idolatrous creeds. To return to the
Mussulman Dards, it will be easy to perceive by a reference
to my ethnographical vocabulary what notions are Muhammadan
and what traces there remain of a more ancient
belief. The “world of Gods” is not the mere ‎‏اخرة‏‎ which
their professed religion teaches, nor is the “serpent world”
a Muhammadan term for our present existence. Of course,
their Maulvis may read “religious lessons” and talk to
them of Paradise and Hell, but it is from a more ancient
source that they derive a kindly sympathy with the evil
spirits “Yatsh;” credit them with good actions, describe
their worship of the sun and moon, and fill the interior of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
mountains with their palaces and songs. Again, it is not
Islam that tells them of the regeneration of their country
by fairies—that places these lovely beings on the top of the
Himalayas and makes them visit, and ally themselves to,
mankind. The fairies too are not all good, as the Yatsh
are not all bad. They destroy the man who seeks to
surprise their secrets, although, perhaps, they condone the
offence by making him live for ever after in fairy-land.
Indeed, the more we look into the national life of the
Dards the less do we find it tinctured by Muhammadan
distaste of compromise. Outwardly their customs may
conform to that ceremonial, but when they make death an
opportunity for jokes and amusement we cannot refuse
attention to the circumstance by merely explaining it away
on the ground that they are savages. I have noticed the
prevalence of caste among them, how proud they are of
their Shîn descent, how little (with the exception of the
more devout Chilâsis) they draw upon Scripture for their
personal names, how they honour women and how they
like the dog, an animal deemed unclean by other Muhammadans.
The Dards had no hesitation in eating with me,
but I should not be surprised to hear that they did not do
so when Mr. Hayward visited them, for the Hinduized
Mussulman servants that one takes on tours might have
availed themselves of their supposed superior knowledge of
the faith to inform the natives that they were making an
improper concession to an infidel. A good many Dards,
however, have the impression that the English are Mussulmans—a
belief that would not deter them from killing or
robbing a European traveller in some districts, if he had
anything “worth taking.” Gouhar-Amán [called “Gôrmán”
by the people] of Yasin used to say that as the Koran, the
word of God, was sold, there could be no objection to sell
an expounder of the word of God, a Mulla, who unfortunately
fell into his hands. I did not meet any real Shîn
who was a Mulla,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> but I have no doubt that, especially in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Hunza, they are using the services of Mullas in order to
give a religious sanction to their predatory excursions. I
have said that the Dards were generally Shiahs—perhaps
I ought not to include the Shiah Hunzas among Dards as
they speak a non-Aryan language unlike any other that I
know<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>—and as a rule the Shiahs are preyed upon by Sunnis.
Shiah children are kidnapped by Sunnis as an act both
religious and profitable. Shiahs have to go through the
markets of Bokhara denying their religion, for which deception,
by the way, they have the sanction of their own
priests.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Can we, therefore, wonder that the Mulái Hunzas
make the best of both worlds by preferring to kidnap Sunnis
to their own co-religionists? A very curious fact is the
attachment of Shiahs to their distant priesthood. We know
how the Indian Shiahs look to Persia; how all expect the
advent of their Messiah, the Imám Mahdi; how the appointment
of Kazis (civil functionaries) is made through
the Mujtehid [a kind of high priest] and is ratified by the
ruling power, rather than emanate direct from the secular
authorities, as is the case with Sunnis. The well-known
Sayad residing at Bombay, Agha Khan, has adherents
even in Dardistan, and any command that may reach them
from him [generally a demand for money] is obeyed implicitly.
Indeed, throughout India and Central Asia there are
men, some of whom lead an apparently obscure life, whose importance
for good or evil should not be underrated by the
authorities. [See my “Hunza and Nagyr Handbook, 1893.”]</p>

<p>What we know about the religion of the Siah-Posh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Kafirs [whom I include in the term “Dards”] is very
little. My informants were two Kafir lads, who lived for
some weeks in my compound and whose religious notions
had, no doubt, been affected on their way down through
Kashmir. That they go once a year to the top of a mountain
as a religious exercise and put a stone on to a cairn;
that the number of Muhammadan heads hung up in front
of their doors indicates their position in the tribe; that
they are said to sit on benches rather than squat on the
ground like other Asiatics: that they are reported to like
all those who wear a curl in front; that they are fair and
have blue eyes, that they drink a portion of the blood of a
killed enemy—this and the few words which have been
collected of their language is very nearly all we have hitherto
known about them. What I have been able to ascertain
regarding them, will be mentioned elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<h3 id="heading_h">H. FORMS OF GOVERNMENT AMONG THE DARDS.</h3>

<p>Chilâs, which sends a tribute every year to Kashmir for
the sake of larger return-presents rather than as a sign of
subjection, is said to be governed by a council of elders, in
which even women are admitted.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> When I visited Gilgit,
in 1866, it was practically without a ruler, the invading
troops of Kashmir barely holding their own within a few
yards of the Gilgit Fort—a remarkable construction
which, according to the report of newspapers, was blown
up by accident in 1876, and of which the only record is
the drawing published in the <i>Illustrated London News</i> of
the 12th February 1870.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> There is now (1877) a Thanadar
of Gilgit, whose rule is probably not very different from
that of his rapacious colleagues in Kashmir. The Gilgitis
are kept quiet by the presence of the Kashmir army, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
by the fact that their chiefs are prisoners at Srinagar, where
other representatives of once reigning houses are also under
surveillance. Mansur Ali Khan, the supposed rightful
Raja of Gilgit is there; he is the son of Asghar Ali
Khan, son of Raja Khan, son of Gurtam Khan—but
legitimate descent has little weight in countries that are
constantly disturbed by violence, except in Hunza, where
the supreme right to rob is hereditary.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The Gilgitis,
who are a little more settled than their neighbours to the
West, North and South, and who possess the most refined
Dardu dialect and traditions, were constantly exposed to
marauding parties, and the late ruler of Yasin, Gouhar-Amán,
who had conquered Gilgit, made it a practice to
sell them into slavery on the pretext that they were Shiahs
and infidels. Yasin was lately ruled by Mir Wali, the
supposed murderer of Mr. Hayward, and is a dependency
of Chitrál, a country which is ruled by Amán-ul-mulk.
The Hunza people are under Ghazan Khan, the son of
Ghazanfar,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and seem to delight in plundering their Kirghiz
neighbours, although all travellers through that inhospitable
region, with the exception of Badakhshan merchants, are
impartially attacked by these robbers, whose depredations
have caused the nearest pass from Central Asia to India to be
almost entirely deserted (1866). At Gilgit I saw the young
Raja of Nagyr, with a servant, also a Nagyri. He was a
most amiable and intelligent lad, whose articulation was
very much more refined than that of his companion, who
prefixed a guttural to every Khajuná word beginning with
a vowel. The boy was kept a prisoner in the Gilgit Fort
as a hostage to Kashmir for his father’s good behaviour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and it was with some difficulty that he was allowed to see
me and answer certain linguistic questions which I put to
him. If he has not been sent back to his country, it would
be a good opportunity for our Government to get him to
the Panjab in the cold weather with the view of our obtaining
more detailed information than we now possess regarding
the Khajuná, that extraordinary language to which I have
several times alluded. [This was done on my second official
mission to Kashmir in 1886.]</p>

<p>The name of <i>Rá</i>, <i>Rásh</i>, <i>Raja</i>, applied to Muhammadans,
may sound singular to those accustomed to connect them
with Hindu rulers but it is the ancient name for “King”
at Gilgit (for which “Nawab” seems a modern substitute
in that country)—whilst Shah Kathor<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> in Chitrál, Tham in
Hunza and Nagyr, Mitérr (Mihtar) and Bakhté in Yasin
and Trakhné in Gilgit offer food for speculation. The Hunza
people say that the King’s race is Mogholote (or Mogul?);
they call the King <i>Sawwash</i> and affirm that he is Aishea
(this probably means that he is descended from Ayesha, the
wife of Muhammad).<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Under the king or chief, for the
time being, the most daring or intriguing hold office and a
new element of disturbance has now been introduced into
Dardistan by the Kashmir faction at every court [or rather
robber’s nest] which seeks to advance the interests or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
ulterior plans of conquest of the Maharaja, our feudatory.
Whilst the name of Wazir is now common for a “minister,” we
find the names of the subordinate offices of Trangpá, Yarfá,
Zeytú, Gopá, etc., etc., which point to the reminiscences
of Tibetan Government and a reference to the “Official
Designations” in Part II. of my “Dardistan” will direct
speculation on other matters connected with the subject.</p>

<p>I need scarcely add that under a Government, like that
of Chitrál, which used to derive a large portion of its
revenue from kidnapping, the position of the official slave-dealer
(Diwánbigi)<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> was a high one. Shortly before I
visited Gilgit, a man used to sell for a good hunting dog
(of which animal the Dards are very fond), two men for a
pony and three men for a large piece of pattú (a kind of
woollen stuff). Women and weak men received the preference,
it being difficult for them to escape once they have
reached their destination. Practically, all the hillmen are
republicans. The name for servant is identical with that
of “companion;” it is only the prisoner of another tribe
who is a “slave.” The progress of Kashmir will certainly
have the effect of stopping, at any rate nominally, the trade
in <i>male</i> slaves, but it will reduce all subjects to the same
dead level of slavery and extinguish that spirit of freedom,
and with it many of the traditions, that have preserved the
Dard races from the degeneracy which has been the fate of
the Aryans who reached Kashmir and India. The indigenous
Government is one whose occasional tyranny is often relieved
by rebellion. I think the Dard Legends and Songs show
that the Dards are a superior people to the Dogras, who
wish to take their country in defiance of treaty obligations,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
and I, for one, would almost prefer the continuance of
present anarchy which may end in a national solution or
in a <i>direct alliance</i> with the British, to the <i>épicier</i> policy of
Kashmir which, without shedding blood,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> has drained the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
resources of that Paradise on earth and killed the intellectual
and moral life of its people. The administration of justice
and the collection of the taxes in Dardistan are carried on,
the former with some show of respect for religious injunctions,
the latter with sole regard to whatever the tax-gatherer
can immediately lay his hand upon.</p>

<h3 id="heading_i">I. HABITATIONS.</h3>

<p>Most of the villages, whose names I have given elsewhere,
are situate on the main lines of roads which, as
everywhere in Himalayan countries, generally coincides
with the course of rivers. The villages are sometimes
scattered, but as a rule, the houses are closely packed
together. Stones are heaped up and closely cemented, and
the upper story, which often is only a space shielded by
a cloth or by grass-bundles on a few poles, is generally
reached by a staircase from the outside.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Most villages
are protected by one or more wooden forts, which—with
the exception of the Gilgit fort—are rude blockhouses,
garnished with rows of beams, behind which it is easy to
fight as long as the place is not set on fire. Most villages
also contain an open space, generally near a fountain, where
the villagers meet in the evening and young people make
love to each other.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Sometimes the houses contain a
subterranean apartment which is used as a cellar or stable—at
other times, the stable forms the lower part of the house
and the family live on the roof under a kind of grass-tent.
In Ládak, a little earth heaped up before the door and
impressed with a large wooden seal, was sufficient, some
years ago, to protect a house in the absence of its owner.
In Dardistan bolts, etc., show the prevailing insecurity.
I have seen houses which had a courtyard, round which
the rooms were built, but generally all buildings in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Dardistan are of the meanest description—the mosque of
Gilgit, in which I slept one night whilst the Sepoys were burying
two or three yards away from me, those who were killed
by the so-called rebels, being almost as miserable a construction
as the rest. The inner part of the house is generally
divided from the outer by a beam which goes right across.
My vocabulary will show all the implements, material, etc., used
in building, etc. Water-mills and windmills are to be found.</p>

<p>Cradles were an unknown commodity till lately. I have
already referred to the wine and treasury cellars excavated in
the mountains, and which provided the Dards with food
during the war in 1866, whilst the invading Kashmir troops
around them were starving. Baths (which were unknown
till lately) are sheltered constructions under waterfalls; in
fact, they are mere sheltered douche-baths. There is no
pavement except so far as stones are placed in order to
show where there are <i>no</i> roads. The rooms have a fire-place,
which at Astor (where it is used for the reception of
live coals) is in the middle of the room. The conservancy
arrangements are on the slope of the hills close to the
villages, in front of which are fields of Indian corn, etc.</p>

<h3 id="heading_j">J. DIVISIONS OF THE DARD RACES.</h3>

<p>The name of Dardistan (a hybrid between the “Darada” of
Sanscrit writings and a Persian termination) seems now to be
generally accepted. I include in it all the countries lying
between the Hindu Kush and Kaghan (lat. 37° N. and long.
73° E. to lat. 35° N., long. 74° 30´ E.). In a restricted sense
the Dards are the race inhabiting the mountainous country of
Shináki, detailed further on, but I include under that designation
not only the Chilâsis, Astóris, Gilgitis, Dareylis, etc.,
but also the people of Hunza, Nagyr, Yasin, Chitrál and
Kafiristan.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> As is the case with uncivilized races generally,
the Dards have no name in common, but call each Dard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
tribe that inhabits a different valley by a different name.
This will be seen in subjoined Extract from my Ethnographical
Vocabulary. The name “Dard” itself was not
claimed by any of the race that I met. If asked whether
they were “Dards” they said “certainly,” thinking I mispronounced
the word “dáde” of the Hill Panjabi which
means “wild” “independent,” and is a name given them by
foreigners as well as “yaghi,” = rebellious [the country is indifferently
known as Yaghistan, Kohistan and, since my visit
in 1866 as “Dardistan,” a name which I see Mr. Hayward
has adopted]. I hope the name of Dard will be retained,
for, besides being the designation of, at least, <i>one</i> tribe,
it connects the country with a range known in Hindu
mythology and history. However, I must leave this and
other disputed points for the present, and confine myself
now to quoting a page of Part II. of my “Dardistán” for
the service of those whom the philological portion of that
work has deterred from looking at the descriptive part.</p>

<p>“SHIN are all the people of Chilâs, Astór, Dareyl or
<i>Darèll</i>, Gôr, Ghilghit<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> or <i>Gilìt</i>. All these tribes do not
acknowledge the ‘Guraizis,’ a people inhabiting the Guraiz
valley between Chilâs and Kashmîr, as <i>Shîn</i>, although the
Guraizis themselves think so. The Guraizi dialect, however
is undoubtedly Shiná, much mixed with Kashmiri.</p>

<p>“The Shîns<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> call themselves ‘Shin, Shiná lôk, Shinâki,’
and are very proud of the appellation, and in addition to
the above-named races include in it the people of Tòrr,
Hárben, Sazîn, [districts of, or rather near, Chilâs]; Tanyire
[Tangîr] belonging to Darell; also the people of Kholi-Palus
whose origin is Shîn, but who are mixed with Afghans.
Some do not consider the people of Kholi-Palus as Shîn.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
They speak both Shiná and Pukhtu [pronounced by the
Shîn people ‘Postó.’] The Baltis, or Little Tibetans, call
the Shîn and also the Nagyr people ‘Brokhpá,’ or, as a
term of respect, ‘Brokhpá bábo.’<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Offshoots of the ‘Shîn’
people live in Little Tibet and even the district of Dras,
near the Zojilá pass on the Ladâk road towards Kashmîr,
was once Shîn and was called by them <i>Huméss</i>. I was the
first traveller who discovered that there were Shîn colonies
in Little Tibet, viz.: the villages of Shingôtsh, Sáspur,
Brashbrialdo, Bashó, Danàl djúnele, Tâtshin, Dorôt (inhabited
by pure Shîns), Zungôt, Tortzé (in the direction of
Rongdu) and Durò, one day’s march from Skardo.”<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The Kirghiz are described by the Chilâsis as
having flat faces and small noses and are supposed to be
very white and beautiful, to be Nomads and to feed on milk,
butter and mutton.</p>

<p>The Chilâsis call the people between Hunza and the
Pamêr [our Pamir] on the Yarkand road = Gójál.</p>

<p>There are also other Gojáls under a Raja of Gojál on
the Badakhshán road.</p>

<p>The Chílâsis call the Siah Pôsh Kâfirs = Bashgalí (Bashgal
is the name of the country inhabited by this people who
enjoy the very worst reputation for cruelty). They are
supposed to kill every traveller that comes within their
reach and to cut his nose or ear off as a trophy.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The Chilâsis were originally four tribes; viz.:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Bagoté of Buner.</li>
<li>The Kané of Takk.</li>
<li>The Boté of the Chilâs fort.</li>
<li>The Matshuké of the Matshukó fort.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Boté and the Matshuké fought. The latter were
defeated, and are said to have fled into Astor and Little
Tibet territory.</p>

<p>A Foreigner is called “ósho.”</p>

<p>Fellow-countrymen are called “malêki.”</p>

<p>The stature of the Dards is generally slender and wiry
and well suited to the life of a mountaineer. They are
now gradually adopting Indian clothes, and whilst this will
displace their own rather picturesque dress and strong,
though rough, indigenous manufacture, it may also render
them less manly. They are fairer than the people of the
plains (the women of Yasin being particularly beautiful
and almost reminding one of European women), but on
the frontier they are rather mixed—the Chilâsis with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Kaghanis and Astóris—the Astóris and Gilgitis with the
Tibetans, and the Guraizis with the Tibetans on the one
hand and the Kashmiris on the other. The consequence
is that their sharp and comparatively clear complexion
(where it is not under a crust of dirt) approaches, in some
Districts, a Tatar or Moghal appearance. Again, the
Nagyris are shorter than the people of Hunza to whom I
have already referred. Just before I reached the Gilgit
fort, I met a Nagyri, whose yellow moustache and general
appearance almost made me believe that I had come across
a Russian in disguise. I have little hesitation in stating
that the pure Shîn looks more like a European than any
high-caste Brahmin of India. Measurements were taken
by Dr. Neil of the Lahore Medical College, but have,
unfortunately, been lost, of the two Shîns who accompanied
me to the Panjab, where they stayed in my house for a few
months, together with other representatives of the various
races whom I had brought down with me.<a name="FNanchor_75a" id="FNanchor_75a"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The prevalence
of caste among the Shîns also deserves attention. We
have not the Muhammadan Sayad, Sheykh, Moghal, and
Pathan (which, no doubt, will be substituted in future for
the existing caste designations), nor the Kashmiri Muhammadan
equivalents of what are generally mere names for
occupations. The following List of Dard Castes may be
quoted appropriately from Part II. of my “Dardistan”:—</p>

<h3 id="heading_k">K. CASTES.</h3>

<p>“Raja (highest on account of position).</p>

<p>“Wazîr (of <span class="smcap">Shîn</span> race, and also the official caste of ‘Róno’).</p>

origin, whether they be Astóris, Gilgitis, Chilâsis, etc., etc.<a name="FNanchor_75b" id="FNanchor_75b"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>“They say that it is the same race as the ‘Moghals’ of
India. Probably this name only suggested itself to them
when coming in contact with Mussulmans from Kashmir or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>

of rank (for exact details, see “Hunza Handbook”):</p>

        ‘Yáshkûni;’] but no Yáshkunn can marry a Shînóy = Shîn woman.</td>

<p>“<i>N.B.</i> The <i>Brokhpâ</i> are a mixed race of Dardu-Tibetans,
as indeed are the Astoris [the latter of whom,
however, consider themselves very pure Shîns]; the <i>Guráïzis</i>
are probably Dardu-Kashmiris; but I presume that the
above division of caste is known, if not upheld, by every
section of the Shîná people. The castes most prevalent in
Guraiz are evidently Kashmiri as:</p>

<h2 id="LEGENDS_RELATING_TO_ANIMALS"><i>LEGENDS RELATING TO ANIMALS.</i><a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></h2>

<h3>1.—A BEAR PLAYS WITH A CORPSE.</h3>

<p>It is said that bears, as the winter is coming on, are in the habit of filling
their dens with grass and that they eat a plant, called “ajalí,” which has a
narcotic effect upon them and keeps them in a state of torpor during the
winter. After three months, when the spring arrives, they awake and go
about for food. One of these bears once scented a corpse which he disinterred.
It happened to be that of a woman who had died a few days
before. The bear, who was in good spirits, brought her to his den, where
he set her upright against a stone and fashioning a spindle with his teeth
and paws gave it to her into one hand and placed some wool into the
other. He then went on growling “mû-mû-mû” to encourage the woman
to spin. He also brought her some nuts and other provisions to eat. Of
course, his efforts were useless, and when she after a few days gave signs
of decomposition he ate her up in despair. This is a story based on the
playful habits of the bear.</p>

<h3>2.—A BEAR MOURNS A GIRL.</h3>

<p>Another curious story is related of a bear. Two women, a mother and
her little daughter, were one night watching their field of Indian corn
“makai,” against the inroads of these animals. The mother had to go to
her house to prepare the food and ordered her daughter to light a fire
outside. Whilst she was doing this a bear came and took her away. He
carried her into his den, and daily brought her to eat and to drink. He
rolled a big stone in front of the den, whenever he went away on his tours,
which the girl was not strong enough to remove. When she became old
enough to be able to do this he used daily to lick her feet, by which they
became swollen and gradually dwindled down to mere misshapen stumps.
The girl eventually died in childbirth, and the poor bear after vain efforts
to restore her to life roamed disconsolately about the fields.</p>

<h3>3.—ORIGIN OF BEARS.</h3>

<p>It is said that bears were originally the offspring of a man who was driven
into madness by his inability to pay his debts, and who took to the hills in
order to avoid his creditors.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<h3>4.—THE BEAR AND THE ONE-EYED MAN.</h3>

<p>The following story was related by a man of the name of Ghalib Shah
residing at a village near Astór, called Parishing. He was one night
looking out whether any bear had come into his “tromba” field.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
saw that a bear was there and that he with his forepaws alternately took a
pawful of “tromba,” blew the chaff away and ate hastily. The man was
one-eyed [shéo = blind; my Ghilgiti used “Kyor,” which he said was a
Persian word, but which is evidently Turkish] and ran to his hut to get his
gun. He came out and pointed it at the bear. The animal who saw this
ran round the blind side of the man’s face, snatched the gun out of his
hand and threw it away. The bear and the man then wrestled for a time,
but afterwards both gave up the struggle and retired. The man, after he
had recovered himself went to look for the gun, the stock of which he found
broken. The match-string by which the stock had been tied to the barrel
had gone on burning all night and had been the cause of the gun being
destroyed. The son of that man still lives at the village and tells this
story, which the people affect to believe.</p>

<h3>5.—WEDDING FESTIVAL AMONG BEARS.</h3>

<p>A Mulla, of the name of Lal Mohammad, said that when he was taken a
prisoner into Chilás,<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> he and his escort passed one day through one of the
dreariest portions of the mountains of that inhospitable region. There
they heard a noise, and quietly approaching to ascertain its cause they saw
a company of bears tearing up the grass and making bundles of it which
they hugged. Other bears again wrapped their heads in grass, and some
stood on their hind-paws, holding a stick in their forepaws and dancing to
the sound of the howls of the others. They then ranged themselves in
rows, at each end of which was a young bear; on one side a male, on the
other a female. These were supposed to celebrate their marriage on the
occasion in question. My informant swore to the story and my Ghilgiti
corroborated the truth of the first portion of the account, which he said
described a practice believed to be common to bears.</p>

<h3>6.—THE FLYING PORCUPINE.</h3>

<p>There is a curious superstition with regard to an animal called “Harginn,”
which appears to be more like a porcupine than anything else. It is
covered with bristles; its back is of a red-brownish and its belly of a
yellowish colour. That animal is supposed to be very dangerous, and to
contain poison in its bristles. At the approach of any man or animal it is
said to gather itself up for a terrific jump into the air, from which it
descends unto the head of the intended victim. It is said to be generally
about half a yard long and a span broad. Our friend Lal Mohammad, a
saintly Akhunzada, but a regular Münchhausen, affirmed to have once met
with a curious incident with regard to that animal. He was out shooting
one day when he saw a stag which seemed intently to look in one direction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
He fired off his gun, which however did not divert the attention of the
stag. At last, he found out what it was that the stag was looking at. It
turned out to be a huge “Harginn,” which had swallowed a large Markhor
with the exception of his horns! There was the porcupine out of whose
mouth protruded the head and horns of the Markhor!! My Ghilgiti, on
the contrary, said that the Harginn was a great snake “like a big fish called
Nang.” Perhaps, Harginn means a monster or dragon, and is applied to
different animals in the two countries of Ghilghit and Astor.</p>

<h3>7.—A FIGHT BETWEEN WOLVES AND A BEAR WHO WANTED TO DIG THEIR GRAVE.</h3>

<p>A curious animal something like a wolf is also described. The species
is called “Kō.”<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> These animals are like dogs; their snouts are of a red
colour, and are very long; they hunt in herds of ten or twenty and track
game which they bring down, one herd or one Kō, as the case may be,
relieving the other at certain stages. A Shikári once reported that he saw
a large number of them asleep. They were all ranged in a single long line.
A bear approached, and by the aid of a long branch measured the line.
He then went to some distance and measuring the ground dug it out to the
extent of the line in length. He then went back to measure the breadth of
the sleeping troop when his branch touched one of the animals which at
once jumped up and roused the others. They all then pursued him and
brought him down. Some of them harassed him in front, whilst one of
them went behind and sucked his stomach clean out. This seems to be
a favourite method of these animals in destroying game. They do not
attack men, but bring down horses, sheep and game.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Flora and Fauna of Dardistan have been so minutely described in
Part II. of my “Languages and Races of Dardistan,” though mainly from
a linguistic standpoint, that I have nothing to say here about the products
and animals of that country. Nor need I say anything about the dress of
its people, except that its rolled-up woollen cap is, practically, the sign of
the brotherhood (sometimes like that of Cain) among all members of the
Dard race, and, at once, distinguishes them from Pathans, Affghans,
Kashmiris, and others. The beautifully-knit stockings are also a Dard art,
and seem to have suggested, rather than followed, Kashmir patterns.
Above all, the quasi-Celtic brass brooches of the women, and the family
axes of the Hunza-Nagyris denote the antiquity of the Dard race. Curious
is also the dress, light as air and softly warm, made of the fluff of the white
giant vulture or of that of the wild fowl. I must also refer the reader who
wishes to know details about the rivers, mountains, etc., of Dardistan, and
the occupations of its peoples, to Part II. of my “Languages and Races of
Dardistan,” and to the main volume, of which this is a Supplement, namely,
the so-called “Hunza and Nagyr Handbook,” a volume of 247 folio pages.</p>

<h2 id="GENEALOGIES_AND_HISTORY_OF_DARDISTAN">GENEALOGIES AND HISTORY OF DARDISTAN.</h2>

<p>I do not propose to do more in this place than give the roughest outline
of this subject, as sketched in 1866 and 1872, and now rapidly
brought up to date. My reason is to prevent those falsifications of History
which are inevitable when a conqueror annexes a new country and the
vilest in it naturally becomes his first friends, and fabricate their family
tree. Therefore, with all its errors, which subsequent enquiries have
corrected, there is an element of actuality in the following accounts
gathered from Dards in 1866, the value of which will become apparent
when I write the history of the events that are drawing Dardistan into the
devastating range of European influences and politics:</p>

</div>

<h4>II.—YASIN DYNASTY.</h4>

<p>It is said that both the Yasin and the Chitral
dynasties are descended from a common ancestor “Kathôr.” The Gilgitis
call the Yasînis “Poryalé” and the Chitralis “Katoré.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Khushwakt</i>(?) died 1800(?) from whom the present dynasty derives the
name of “Khushwaktia.” [A Raja of that name and dignity often met me
at Srinagar in 1886.]</p>

<p>He had two sons <i>Suleyman Shah and Malik Amán Shah</i>. The former
died about 1829 and left four sons and a daughter whom he married to
Ghazanfar, the Rajah of Hunza. The names of the sons are Azmat Shah
the eldest, Ahmad Shah, Rahîm Khan and Zarmast Khan.</p>

<p><i>Malik Amán Shah</i> was the father of seven or, as some say, of ten sons,
the most famous of whom was <span class="smcap">Gauhar Aman</span>, surnamed “Adam farosh”
(the man-seller) the third son. The names of the sons are: Khuda Amán
Duda Amán, Gauhar Amán, Khalîl Amán, Akhar Amán (who was killed
by his nephew Malik Amán, eldest son of his brother Gauhar Amán): <span class="smcap">Isa
Bahadur</span> (son of Malik Amán Shah by a concubine), Gulsher, Mahter
Sakhi, Bahadur Khan (who was murdered) and Mir Amán(?) of Mistuch(?)</p>

<p><i>Gauhar Amán</i> left seven sons: <span class="smcap">Malik Amán</span> (also called Mîr Kammu?
now in Tangîr?) Bahadur Amán, murdered by Lochan Singh, <span class="smcap">Mir Vali</span>
(who killed Hayward), Mir Gházi, <span class="smcap">Pahlwan</span> (who killed Mir Vali), Khan
Daurán and Shajáyat Khan. [The Khushwaktia Dynasty has since been
dispossessed by the kindred dynasty of Chitrál in 1884.]</p>

<h4>III.—CHITRAL OR “SHAH KATHORIA” DYNASTY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Shah Kathor</span>, the son of Shah Afzal, (who died about 1800) was a
soldier of fortune who dispossessed the former ruler, whose grandson Vigne
saw in the service of Ahmad Shah, the independent ruler of Little Tibet
in 1835. Cunningham considers that the name of Kathôr is a title that
has been borne by the rulers of Chitrál for 2,000 years.</p>

<p><i>Shah Kathor</i> had a brother, Sarbaland Khan, whose descendants do
not concern us, and four sons and a daughter married to Gauhar Amán of
Yasin. The names of the sons were: <i>Shah Afzal</i> (who died in 1858),
Tajammul Shah who was killed in 1865 by his nephew Adam-khor—or
man-eater—(so called from his murderous disposition; his real name was
Muhtarim Shah), Ghazab Shah (who died a natural death) and Afrasiab (who
was killed). The murdered Tajammul Shah left two sons namely Malik Shah
(who revenged his father’s death by killing Adam Khôr), and Sayad Ali Shah.</p>

<p><i>Shah Afzal</i> left <span class="smcap">Amán-ul-Mulk</span>, his eldest son, the present ruler of
Chitrál [1872] Adam-khôr (who usurped the rule for a time); Kohkán Beg,
ruler of Drus; a daughter whom he married to Rahmat-ulla-Khan, chief
of Dîr; Muhammad Ali Beg; Yadgar Beg; Bahadur Khan; and another
daughter whom Gauhar-Amán married as well as Shah Afzal’s sister and
had Pahlwan by her.</p>

<p>Amán-ul-Mulk married a daughter of the late Ghazan Khan, chief of
Dîr, by whom he had Sardar (his eldest son), also called Nizam-ul-Mulk.
Amán-ul-Mulk’s other sons are Murad and others whose names will be found
elsewhere. One of his daughters is married to Jehandar Shah, the former
ruler of Badakhshán and the other to the son of the present Chief, Mîr
Mahmud Shah. [Full details are given elsewhere of the Yasin-Chitrál house.]</p>

<p>IV.—The names of the principal chiefs of the Chilâsis and of the
Yaghistanis (the independent Hill tribes of Darêl, Hôdûr, Tangìr, etc.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
have already been given in my “history” of their “Wars with Kashmir.”
Just as in Chilâs and Kandiá, the administration is in the hands of a
Board of Elders. The Maharaja of Kashmir only obtains tribute from
three villages in Chilaz, <i>viz.</i>, the villages of Chilás, Takk and Bundar.</p>

<h4>V.—<span class="smcap">Nagyr</span>,<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></h4>

<p class="noindent">[is tributary to Ahmad Shah of Little Tibet about the beginning of this
century, but soon throws off this allegiance to Ahmad Shah under Alif
Khan.](?)</p>

<p class="smaller">[<a href="#D_Legend">See “Historical Legend of the Origin of Gilgit,” pages 9 to 16.</a> The
Nagyr-Hunza Rajas or Thams similarly claim a divine origin and account
for it through the two fairy-brothers who disappeared at Gilgit. <a href="#Page_111">See
note on page 111.</a>]</p>

<p class="smaller">[“Nagyr,” which Col. Biddulph very properly writes “Nager” (like “Pamèr”)
is now spelt “Nag<i>a</i>r,” so as to confound it with the Indian “Nagar” for
“town,” from which it is quite different.]</p>

<h2 id="CHRONOLOGICAL_SKETCH"><i>ROUGH CHRONOLOGICAL SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF DARDISTAN SINCE 1800.</i></h2>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1800.—Gurtam Khan, hereditary ruler of the now dispossessed Gilgit
Dynasty, rules 10 years in peace; is killed in an engagement
with Suleyman Khan, Khushwaktia, great uncle of the famous
Gauhar Amán (or Gormán) of Yasin.</p>

<p>1811.—Muhammad Khan, the son of Gurtam Khan, defeats Suleyman
Khan, rules Gilgit for 15 years in peace and perfect independence
whilst—</p>

<p>1814.—(Sirdar Muhammad Azim Khan, Barakzai, is ruler of Kashmir).</p>

<p>1819.—Ranjit Singh annexes Kashmir.</p>

<p>1826.—Suleyman Khan of Yasin again attacks Gilgit and kills Muhammad
Khan and his brother, Abbas Ali. Muhammad Khan’s son,
Asghar Ali, is also killed on his flight to Nagyr.</p>

<p>1827.—Suleyman Shah appoints Azad Khan(?), petty Raja of Gakutsh,
over Gilgit as far as Bunji; Azad Khan ingratiates himself with
the people and rebels against Suleyman Shah whom he kills(?)
in 1829.</p>

<p>1829.—Suleyman Shah, head of the Khushwaktia family of Yasin, dies.</p>

<p>1833.—Gauhar Amán turns his uncle, Azmat Shah, out of Yasin.</p>

<p>1834.—Azad Khan is attacked by Tahir Shah of Nagyr and killed. Tahir
Shah, a Shiah, treats his subjects well. Dies 1839. Vigne visits
Astór in 1835, but Tahir Shah will not allow him to cross over
to Gilgit. At that time the Sikhs had not conquered any Dard
country. Ahmad Shah was independent ruler of Little Tibet
(Baltistan) and under him was Jabar Khan, chief of Astór (whose
descendants,<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> like those of Ahmad Shah himself and of the
Ladak rulers are now petty pensioners under Kashmir surveillance).
(The Little Tibet dynasty had once, under Shah Murad,
about 1660, conquered Hunza, Nagyr, Gilgit and Chitrál, where
that ruler built a bridge near the fort.) Zorawar Singh conquers
Little Tibet in 1840, but no interference in Dard affairs takes
place till 1841 when the Sikhs are called in as temporary allies
by the Gilgit ruler against Gauhar Amán of Yasin.</p>

<p>1840.—Sakandar Khan, son of Tahir Shah, succeeds to the throne of
Gilgit and rules the country—with his brothers, Kerim Khan and
Suleyman Khan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>1841.—Gauhar Amán of Yasin conquers Gilgit. Its ruler, Sikandar Khan,
asks Sheikh Ghulam Muhi-ud-din, Governor of Kashmir on behalf
of the Sikhs, for help.</p>

<p>1842.—1,000 Kashmir troops sent under Nathe Shah, a Panjabi.</p>

<p>1843.—Sikandar Khan is murdered at Bakrôt at the instigation of Gauhar
Amán.</p>

<p>1844.—Gauhar Amán of Yasin re-conquers the whole country, selling
many of its inhabitants into slavery.</p>

<p class="not">Nathe Shah, joined by Kerim Khan, younger brother of Sikandar
Khan and 4,000 reinforcements, takes Numal Fort, but his
subordinate Mathra Das is met at Sher Kila (20 miles from
Gilgit) by Gauhar Amán and defeated.</p>

<p>1845.—Karim Khan succeeds his brother as ruler (called “Raja,” although
a Muhammadan) of Gilgit and pays a small sum for the retention
of some Kashmir troops in the Gilgit Fort under Nathe Shah.
The Rajas of Hunza, Nagyr and Yasin [Gauhar Amán sending
his brother Khalil Amán to Sheikh Iman-ud-din] now seek to be
on good terms with Kashmir, especially as its representatives, the
tyrannical Nathe Shah and his equally unpopular successor, Atar
Singh, are removed by its Muhammadan Governor.</p>

<p>1846.—Karim Khan, Raja of Gor, another son of Tahir Shah, calls in
Nathe Shah and defeats Gauhar Amán at Basin, close to Gilgit.
A succession of officers of Ghulab Singh then administer the
country in connexion with the Raja of Gilgit (Wazir Singh, Ranjit
Rai, Bakhshu, Ali Bakhsh and Ahmad Ali Shah, brother or
cousin of Nathe Shah). By Treaty (<a href="#Page_110">see page 110</a>):</p>

<p class="not">“<span class="smcap">Kashmir and its dependencies eastward of the Indus</span>”
are made over by the British to the Hindu Ghulab Singh. Gilgit,
which lies to the <i>westward</i> of the Indus, is thus excluded from
the dominions of that Maharaja. Gilgit was also, strictly speaking,
not a dependency of Kashmir, nor was Chilás.</p>

<p>1847.—The Maharaja restores Nathe Shah, whilst confirming his cousin
Nazar Ali Shah as Military Commandant of Gilgit. Raja Kerim
Khan sends his brother Suleyman Khan on a friendly mission to
Srinagar, where he dies. Vans Agnew arrives at Chalt on the
Gilgit frontier towards Nagyr and makes friends with the people,
who at first thought that he came accompanied by troops.</p>

<p>1848.—Isa Bahadur, the half-brother of Gauhar Amán by a concubine of
Malik Amán Shah, is expelled from Sher Kila, a Fort belonging
to Punyal, a dependency of Yasin, and finds refuge with the
Maharaja, who refuses to give him up. Gauhar Amán accordingly
sends troops under his brother Akbar Amán and captures
the Bargu and Shukayôt Forts in Gilgit territory. The Rajas
of Hunza and Nagyr combine with Gauhar Amán and assisted
by the Gilgit people, with whom Kerim Khan was unpopular
because of his friendship for Kashmir, defeat and kill Nathe
Shah and Kerim Khan. Gauhar Amán captures the Gilgit and
Chaprôt Forts. The Kashmir troops re-invade the country and
at the beginning of</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>1849.—Wrest all the forts in Gilgit territory from Gauhar Amán, and make
over the rule of that country to Raja Muhammad Khan, son of
Kerim Khan, assisted by the Kashmir representative, Aman Ali
Shah as Thanadar, soon removed for oppression.</p>

<p>1850.—The raids of the Chilâsis on Astór is made the occasion for invading
the country of Chilâs, which, <i>not</i> being a dependency of Kashmir,
is <i>not</i> included in the Treaty of 1846. (<a href="#Page_110">See page 110.</a>) The
Maharaja gives out that he is acting under orders of the British
Government. Great consternation among petty chiefs about
Muzaffarabad, regarding ulterior plans of the Maharaja. The Sikhs
send a large army, which is defeated before the Fort of Chilâs.</p>

<p>1851.—Bakhshi Hari Singh and Dewan Hari Chand are sent with 10,000
men against Chilâs and succeed in destroying the fort and
scattering the hostile hill tribes which assisted the Chilâsis.</p>

<p>1852.—The Maharaja’s head officers, Santu Singh and Ramdhan, are
murdered by the people of Gilgit whom they oppressed. The
people again assist Gauhar Amán, who defeats and kills Bhup
Singh and Ruknuddin (for details <a href="#APPENDICES"><i>vide</i> Appendix</a>), and drives the
Kashmir troops across the Indus to Astór.</p>

<p>1853.—The Maharaja now confines himself to the frontier, assigned to
him by nature as well as the treaty, at Bunji, on the east of the
Indus, but sends agents to sow discord in the family of Gauhar
Amán. In addition to Isa Bahadur, he gained over two other
brothers, Khalil Amán and Akbar Amán, but failed with Mahtar
Sakhi, although an exile. He also attracted to his side Azmat
Shah, Gauhar Amán’s uncle.</p>

<p>1854.—The Maharaja instigated Shah Afzal of Chitrál to attack Gauhar
Amán, and accordingly in</p>

<p>1855.—Adam Khor, son of Shah Afzal of Chitrál, drove Gauhar Amán from
the possession of Mistuch and Yasin and restricted him to Punyal
and Gilgit.</p>

<p>1856.—The Maharaja sends a force across the Indus under Wazir Zoraweru
and Atar Singh assisted by Raja Zahid Jafar of Nagyr,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
and Gauhar Amán thus attacked in front and flank, retreats from
Gilgit and dispossesses Adam Khor from Yasin and Mistuch.</p>

<p>1857.—Gauhar Amán again conquers Gilgit and drives out Isa Bahadur,
officiating Thanadar of that place. Gauhar Amán and the Maharaja
intrigue against each other in Chitrál, Nagyr, Hunza, etc.</p>

<p>1858.—Shah Afzal of the Shah Kathor branch, ruler of Chitrál, dies.</p>

<p class="not">Intrigues in Gilgit against Gauhar Amán, by Muhammad Khan,
son of Raja Karim Khan, assisted by Kashmir. Muhammad
Khan is conciliated by marrying the daughter of Gauhar Amán.
The Sai District of Gilgit beyond the Niludar range is still held
by the Sikhs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>1859.—Mir Shah of Badakhshan and Raja Ghazanfar of Hunza assist
Gauhar Amán in attacking Nagyr, which is under the friendly
Raja Zahid Jafar, and in trying to turn out the Sikhs from Sai
and even Bunji. Azmat Shah, uncle of Gauhar Amán, is expelled
from Chitrál where he had sought refuge.</p>

<p class="not">Aman-ul-Mulk, King of Chitrál, dispossesses his younger brother,
Adam Khor, who had usurped the throne, from the rule of Chitrál
and joins Gauhar Amán against Kashmir.</p>

<p>1860.—The Maharaja instigates Adam Khor and Azmat Shah, who were
in the country of Dir with Ghazan Khan, a friendly chief to
Kashmir, to fight Gauhar Amán—Adam Khor was to have Yasin,
Asmat Shah was to take Mistuch and Sher Kila (Payal) was to
be given to Isa Bahadur, the Maharaja to have Gilgit. Intrigues
of the Maharaja with the Chiefs of Dir, Badakhshan, etc.</p>

<p class="not">Gauhar Amán dies, which is the signal for an attack by the Maharaja
co-operating with the sons of Raja Kerim Khan of Gilgit.
Gilgit falls easily to Lochan Singh, who murders Bahadur Khan,
brother of Gauhar Amán, who was sent with presents from Malik
Amán, also called Mulk Amán, son of Gauhar Amán. The Sikhs,
under Colonels Devi Singh and Hushiara and Radha Kishen,
march to Yasin expelling Mulk Amán from that country (which
is made over to Azmat Shah) as also from Mistuch. Isa Bahadur
is reinstated as ruler of Payal, but Mulk Amán returns and drives
him and Azmat Shah out. The Kashmir troops fail in their
counter-attacks on Yasin, but capture some prisoners, including
Mulk Amán’s wife.</p>

<p>1861.—Malik Amán murders his uncle, Akbar Amán, a partisan of Kashmir.
Badakhshan, Chitrál and Dir ask the Maharaja to assist them
against the dreaded invasion of the Kabul Amirs, Afzal Khan
and Azim Khan. Amán-ul-Mulk tries to get up a religious war
(Jehád) among all the Muhammadan Chiefs. Hunza and Nagyr
make friends. Both Adam Khor and Amán-ul-Mulk, who have
again become reconciled, send conciliatory messages to the
Maharaja, who frustrates their designs, as they are secretly
conspiring against him.</p>

<p class="not">Even Mulk Amán makes overtures, but unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>1862.—Kashmir troops take the Fort of Roshan. A combination is made
against Mulk Amán, whose uncle Gulsher and brother Mir Ghazi
go over to the Maharaja.</p>

<p>1863.—Mulk Amán advancing on Gilgit is defeated in a very bloody battle
at the Yasin Fort of Shamir. Massacre of women and children
by the Kashmir troops at Yasin.</p>

<p>1864.—Mir Vali and his Vazir Rahmat become partisans of the Maharaja.</p>

<p>1865.—Ghazanfar, the Raja of Hunza and father-in-law of Mulk Amán,
dies, which causes Mirza Bahadur of the rival Nagyr to combine
for an attack on Hunza with Kashmir. Adam Khor murders his
uncle, Tajammul Shah, whose son, Malik Shah, murders</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>1866.—Adam Khor (some say at the instigation of his elder brother, Amán-ul-Mulk).
Malik Shah seeks refuge with the Maharaja who will
not give him up to Amán-ul-Mulk. Amán-ul-Mulk then sprung
the mine he had long prepared, and when the long contemplated
campaign against Hunza took place in 1866, all the Mussulman
Chiefs who had been adherents of the Maharaja, including Mir
Vali, fell away. The Kashmir troops which had advanced on
Nummal were betrayed, and defeated by the Hunza people (now
ruled by Ghazan Khan, son of Ghazanfar).</p>

<p class="not">All the hill tribes combine against Kashmir and reduce the Dogras
to the bare possession of Gilgit, which however held out successfully
against more than 20,000 of the allied Dards, headed by
Amán-ul-Mulk, Ghazan Khan and Mir Vali. Very large reinforcements
were sent by Kashmir,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> at whose approach the
besiegers retreated, leaving, however, skirmishers all over the
country.</p>

<p class="not">Wazir Zoraweru followed up the advantage gained by invading
Dareyl. Whilst the place was yet partially invested, Dr. Leitner
made his way to the Gilgit Fort and frustrated two attempts made
against him by the employés of the Maharaja, who ostensibly
were friends.</p>

<p>1867.—Jehandár Shah of Badakhshan is expelled from his country by the
Governor of Balkh and seeks refuge in Kabul, where he is restored
a year afterwards to his ancestral throne by the influence of
Abdurrahman Khan, son of the Amir Afzal Khan and by his
popularity. His rival, Mahmud Shah, leaves without a struggle.
Mir Vali, joining Mulk Amán, made an unsuccessful attack on
Isa Bahadur and Azmat Shah, who beat them off with the help
of Kashmir troops from Gilgit. The consequence was general
disappointment among the Muhammadan Chiefs and the Hill
tribe of Dareyl (which had been subdued in the meantime) and
all opened friendly relations with Kashmir, especially.</p>

<p>1868.—Mir Vali rules Yasin with Pahlwan.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Mulk Amán flees to Chitrál.</p>

<p>1869.—Mulk Amán takes service with Kashmir and is appointed on
salary, but under surveillance, at Gilgit.</p>

<p>1870.—Mr. Hayward visits Yasin in March; is well received by the Chief,
Mir Vali, but returns, as he finds the passes on to the Pamir
closed by snow—visits the country a second time in July, after
exposing the conduct and breach of treaty of the Kashmir
authorities, and is murdered, apparently without any object, at
Darkôt in Yasin, one stage on to Wakhan, by some men in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
service of his former friend, Mir Vali, who, however, soon flies
the country in the direction of Badakhshan, then seeks refuge
with the Akhund of Swat, and finally returns to Yasin, where he
is reported to have been well received by Pahlwan. Whilst
in Chitrál, he was seen by Major Montgomerie’s Havildar
and was on good terms with Amán-ul-Mulk, who is supposed,
chiefly on the authority of a doubtful seal, to be the instigator of
a murder which was not, apparently, to his interests and which
did not enrich him or Mir Vali with any booty, excepting a gun
and a few other trifles. Much of the property of Mr. Hayward
was recovered by the Kashmir authorities, and a monument was
erected by them to his memory at Gilgit, where there is already
a shrine, which is referred to on pages <a href="#Page_47">47</a> and <a href="#Page_51">51</a>.</p>

<p>1871.—Jehandár Shah, son of Mir Shah, who had again been turned out
of the rule of Badakhshan in October 1869 by Mir Mahmud
Shah with the help of the Afghan troops of Amir Sher Ali, finds
an asylum in Chitrál with Amán-ul-Mulk (whose daughter had
been married to his son) after having for some time shared the
fortunes of his friend, the fugitive Abdurrahman Khan of Kabul.
(Chitrál pays an annual tribute to the Chief of Badakhshan in
slaves, which it raises either by kidnapping travellers or independent
Kafirs or by enslaving some of its own Shiah and Kafir
subjects—the ruler being of the Sunni persuasion.)</p>

<p>1872.—Late accounts are confused, but the influence of Amir Sher Ali
seems to be pressing through Badakhshán on Chitrál and through
Bajaur on Swat on the one hand and on the Kafir races on the
other. The Maharaja of Kashmir on the one side and the
Amir of Kabul on the other seem to endeavour to approach
their frontiers at the expense of the intervening Dard and other
tribes. Jehandár Shah infests the Kolab road and would be
hailed by the people of Badakhshan as a deliverer from the
oppressive rule of Mahmud Shah, as soon as the Kabul troops
were to withdraw.</p>

</div>

<p>So far my “Dardistan,” in which a detailed “History of the Wars with
Kashmir” will be found. The events since 1872 need only to be indicated
here in rough outline, and, unfortunately, confirm my worst anticipations
as to the destruction of the independence of the Dardu tribes, of their
legendary lore, and, above all, of the purity of their languages, including
the prehistoric Khajuná or “Burishki” spoken in Hunza-Nagyr, and a part
of Yasin. What are the admitted encroachments of our Ally, the Maharaja
of Kashmir, have been utilized in our supposed interests, and we have
stepped in to profit, as we foolishly think, by his sins, whilst he is tricked
out of their reward. Falsely alleging that Hunza-Nagyr were rebellious
vassals of Kashmir, when Hunza at all events was under Chinese protectorate,
we have reduced their patriotic defenders to practical servitude, and,
by to-day’s <i>Times</i> (21st November, 1892), are starting, along with 250 rifles
and two guns, some 100 men of a Hunza levy to Chitrál to put down a trouble
which our ill-judged interference has created in another independent principality,
where we have put aside the rightful heir, Nizám-ul-Mulk, for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
younger brother, Afzul-ul-Mulk, on the pretext that the former was intriguing
with the Russians. I believe this allegation to be absolutely false, for I
know him to be most friendly to British interests. In 1886 he offered to
send a thousand men from Warshigum over the passes to the relief of
Colonel (now General Sir) W. Lockhart, then a temporary prisoner at
Panjah Fort in Affghan hands. As Padishah of Turikoh, Nizám-ul-Mulk
was, in his father’s life-time, the <i>acknowledged</i> heir to the Chitrál throne, and
he was made by his father Raja of Yasin in succession to Afzul, who had
taken it in 1884 from Mir Amán, the maternal uncle of Pehliwán, who was
ruler of Yasin in 1880, when Colonel Biddulph wrote his “Tribes of the
Hindukush,” and with whom the Khushwaqtia dynasty, as such, came to an
end. This Pehliwan killed Mir Wali, the murderer of Hayward, but
Pehliwan made the mistake of attacking Biddulph in 1880, and was ousted
by Mir Amán. With Nizám-ul-Mulk, therefore, begins the rule over Yasin
by the Kathoria Dynasty of Chitrál. He is now a fugitive at Gilgit; had
he been intriguing with Russia he would certainly not have sought refuge
from his brother in the British lion’s mouth at Gilgit. All I can say is
that in 1886 he did not even know the name of Russia, and that when he
wrote to me in 1887 he referred to the advent of the French explorers
Capus, Pepin and Bonvalot, as follows: “they call themselves sometimes
French, and at other times Russians.” In the “Asiatic Quarterly Review”
of January, 1891, there is a paper from Raja Nizám-ul-Mulk on
“the Legends of Chitrál.” He is thus the first Central Asian prince
whose literary effusion has appeared in the pages of a British, or
indeed of any other, Review. His first letters, sent in the hollow of a twig,
like his latter ones sent through British officers, all breathe a spirit of
what might be called the sincerest loyalty to the Queen-Empress, were he
not an absolutely independent ruler. There will be an evil day of reckoning
when the “meddling and muddling,” which has created the Russian
Frankenstein, will be followed by the exasperation of princes and people,
within and beyond our legitimate frontier. To revert to Hunza and
Nagyr, Mr. F. Drew, an Assistant Master of Eton College, who was <i>in
the service of the Maharaja of Kashmir</i>, wrote in 1877 in his “Northern
Barrier of India”—which, alas! our practical annexation of Kashmir, and
our interference with the Hindukush tribes are breaking down—as follows:
“Hunza and Nagyr are two small <span class="smcap">independent rajaships</span>. Nagyr has
generally shown a desire to be on friendly terms with the Dogras at
Gilgit, while Hunza has been a thorn in their side.” There is not a word
here of these States being tributaries of Kashmir, whilst Colonel Biddulph,
who was our Resident at Gilgit, shows that the last Hunza raid was committed
in 1867, and that slavery and kidnapping were unknown in inoffensive,
if not “timid,” Nagyr. My article in the “Asiatic Quarterly Review”
of January, 1892, shows that raiding and slavery had been recently revived
in consequence of alike Russian and English advances, and that the fussiness
and ambition of our officials have alone <i>indicated</i> and <i>paved</i> “the
nearest way to India.”</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Woking, 21st November, 1892.</i></p>

<p>P.S.—In correcting this proof of a paper on the Fairy-land that adjoins
“the Roof of the World,” which our imprudence has drawn within the
range of practical politics, I never anticipated that I should have to refer
to my “rough sketch of the History of Dardistan” brought down to 1872
as a refutation of the history written to order by some of our leading
journals which, to suit the policy of the moment, would make the Amir of
Affghanistan responsible for Badakhshan, and yet blame him for interfering
with Chitrál, as is hinted in a telegram in to-day’s <i>Times</i>. I shall deal
with this matter elsewhere. (<a href="#APPENDIX_II">See also Appendix II.</a>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">In 5 Chapters—(Chapter I. Chilás)</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Committed to writing from the statements of a Sazíni Dard who took part in
many of the engagements.</i>)</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Introduction.</span> (<span class="smcap">Juin</span>, 1893.)</h3>

<p>Chilás has already been referred to in my “rough Chronological Sketch
of the History of Dardistan from 1800 to 1892.”<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> I now propose to republish
“the History of the Wars of the Dard tribes with Kashmir” beginning
with the account given to me by a Sazîni Dard in 1866 of the first war with
the Chilásis.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Its importance at the present moment, consists in
the fact that these wars with the Dards were almost all provoked by
Kashmir, as they, practically, now are by ourselves. The attack on
peaceful and pious Nagyr was excused by the usual calumnies that precede
and justify annexation, till their exposure comes too late either to prevent
aggression or to punish their authors, who, if soldiers, obtain honours,
and if writers, an evanescent popularity. Now that the manuscripts of the
Hunza Library have been sold by auction, that its fairies have been
silenced, that its ancient weapons have been destroyed, that its language
and religion have been assimilated to those of its neighbours, a living chapter
has disappeared of the most ancient traditions of mankind safe in their
mountain recesses for ages, till English and Russian subalterns wanted promotion
at the expense of the safety of their respective Asiatic Empires. In
1866, I already pointed out that the Legends and Customs of the Dards
were gradually vanishing before the incidental inroads of Orthodox Sunni
Muhammadanism and that their preservation was a duty of the civilized
world. Now we have simply killed them outright as also a number of interesting
Aryan republics, like Chilás and other picturesque and peaceful
autonomies. In 1875, Mr. Drew reported that the abhorrence of the Shin
race to the cow, which probably marked the almost pre-historical separation
of the Dáradas, the lowest of the twice-born, from the Brahmins of
Kashmir, was ceasing, and in 1886 I saw a son of the excellent Raja of
Nagyr in European garb all except the head-dress. Now that his country
is practically annexed, its Chief is called “patriarchal,” just as the Chilásis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
are now patted on the back “as brave and by no means quarrelsome” by
journals which a few months ago termed them “raiders,” “kidnappers”,
“robbers” and “slave-dealers,” etc., forgetting that there exist the annual
reports of our Deputy Commissioners of Abbottabad speaking of them
since 1856 as a peaceable people. No doubt <i>before</i> that date, the Sunni
Chilásis raided Shiah Astor, just as the Astoris raided what they could.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The following account, it will be seen, and my own notes, do not, in the
least, palliate the shortcomings of the Dards, but I maintain that there were <i>no</i>
raids since 1856, and that in 1866 <i>six</i> Kashmir Sepoys, (not 6,000, as alleged
by a recent writer) kept the Astor-Bunji road in a state of perfect safety; there
were, no doubt, small detachments of troops at these places themselves, <i>not</i> to
protect the road against the puritanical peasantry of Chilás, but as Depôts
for the <i>then</i> War with all the united Dard tribes <i>except Chilás</i>. Yet we
are told by a recent writer, ignorant of Dard Languages and History,
that we took Chilás in order to protect Kashmir from raids (which had
ceased for 42 years), that we spend less on the safety of the frontier than
Kashmir, that the Nagyr Raja was a slave-dealer, etc., etc. Fortunately,
we have official and other reports written before the passions of the moment
obscured historical truth, and these Reports will long bear witness against the
vandalism and folly by which our Northern Barrier of India was broken
down and a military road was constructed for an invader to the heart of the
Panjab. This road is the one from Abbottabad to Hunza, of which
I obtained the particulars in 1866 (when I was sent on a linguistic
Mission by the Panjab Government to Kashmir and Chilás), but which,
for obvious reasons, I did not publish. Now that the Indian papers constantly
urge and discuss its construction, I have no hesitation in giving the
details of this, as I have of other roads and as <i>now</i> ought to be done of the
various means of communication throughout what was once called, and
what should, and could, for ever have remained, the “neutral zone” between
the British and the Russian spheres of influence or interference. The first
part of the projected road is to Chilás, and extends, roughly speaking, for
125 miles, namely Abbottabad to Mansehra 16 miles; Mansehra to Juba 10
miles; thence to Balakôt 12 miles; Kawaie 12, Jared 12, Kaghan 12, Naran
14, Batakundi 6, Burawaie 6, Sehri 5, Lulusar (where there is a fine lake
11,000 feet over the sea level) 5, Chilás 15. (For details see elsewhere.) Of
this 15 miles are on independent territory, so that there was no occasion
for the precipitate subjugation of an inoffensive population, whose sense
of security is so great that they abandon their houses entirely unprotected
during the hottest part of the summer when they leave with their families<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
for the cooler surrounding hills. In another Dard republic, full of Arabic
Scholars, Kandiá, there are no forts, and weapons may not be carried.
Major Abbott, from whom Abbottabad so deservedly takes its name, reporting
to the Lahore Board of Administration in July 1855, when the
Maharaja of Kashmir had misinformed him of the successful conclusion
of his campaign against Chilás and had asked the British Government,
“whether he was to hold it with garrison, or to punish the people by burning
their villages and then to retreat,” gave as his opinion that the latter course
would exasperate the Chilásis into renewing their incursions, and that on
the other hand “the possession of Chilás by Jummoo would altogether
destroy the hopes of the Syuds of Kaghan. And as the odium of this very
unpopular expedition has been carefully attributed to the British Government
by the Maharaja’s Ministers, so much of advantage may possibly be
derived from it.” I must now allow my Sazîni and other Dards to give
an account of Wars which not only include the struggles for the conquest
of Chilás, but detail the expeditions to Hunzá-Nagyr, the massacre of women
and children at Yasin, the Dareyl and other conflicts, all interspersed with
characteristic anecdotes and the names of men and places that have, or may
yet, come to the front.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Routes to Chilás.</span></h3>

<p>The manners, tribal sub-divisions, and occupations of the Chilásis and
the names of the mountains, streams, products, etc., of the country,
as also the road from Takk to Kashmir by the Kanagamunn pass,
Diúng, Shiril, Koja, Ujatt, etc., are detailed in my “Dardistan,” where a
Chilási vocabulary, dialogues, songs, etc., will also be found. There are
also roads from Abbottabad to Chilás through Agrôr, of Black Mountain
fame, practicable for camels. Another road, fit for ponies, goes by Muzafarabad
by Sharidi and the lovely Kishenganga and Sargan Rivers in Kashmir,
by the Kamakduri Galli, to Niát in Chilás. As already mentioned, the
easiest road to our last conquest is by Kaghan through the Takk valley.
There is also the long and dangerous road on the banks of the Indus to
Bunji, which skirts, as its occupation would irritate, the Kohistani tribes who
are Pathans, not Dards, including the rival traders with Gilgit of Koli-Palus.
Thence, on that route, comes Jalkot and the road that branches off into
learned Kandiá, which I have described at length in the <i>A.Q.R.</i> of July
1892. The road, such as it is, constantly crosses and recrosses the Indus
(by rafts), and at the Lahtar river is reached the boundary between
the true Kohistan and the Dard country, which is there called Shináki,
because it is inhabited by the ruling Shiná race. We then come to pretty
Sazín, from which my Sazîní informant. Opposite to it runs the Tangir
valley and country, whence there is a road to Yasin to which Tangîr owed
a sort of loose bond. We then continue by the right bank of the Indus
opposite Sazín, passing Shatiál and on to the Dareyl stream, which comes
from the Dareyl country that eventually joins on to Gilgit. Crossing the
Dareyl stream, we pass Harban on the left bank and a few miles further
on, the Tor village, and arrive at the Hôdur village, whence we go on to
Chilás, after as bad a road of about 200 miles as it is possible to conceive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Besides, if we touch the independence of these various republics <i>en route</i>,
we shall constantly be in a hornets’ nest, and provoke the coalition of the
Dard with the Pathan or Afghan irreconcilable tribes, whereas, by keeping
to the Kashmir route or, at least, confining ourselves to the Kaghan-Chilás
road, and prohibiting our men from going to the right or to the left of it,
we may yet resume friendly relations with the harmless and religious Chilásis
and keep the road open for the eventual advance of Russian troops! In
the meanwhile, let us not destroy villages inhabited by hereditary genealogists,
who, before our advent, were the living historians of an irrecoverable
portion of, perhaps, the earliest Aryan settlements.</p>

<h3>I. STRUGGLES FOR THE CONQUEST OF CHILAS.</h3>

<p>“About twenty-three years ago there was a very strong fort at Chilás.
Two years before the outbreak of the wars, a man named Lassu came [on
the part of Kashmír?] to the frontier of Chilás. This man’s ancestors had
been in the service of the Dogras and for ninety years had possessed property
and the Sirdarship at Goré (?) (probably Guraïz) in the family. It is
not known why or whether he was dismissed the Kashmîr service, but he
came with his family in 1847 to Chilás and became the cause of all the
subsequent disturbances. This man had been renowned for bravery in his
youth, but when he came was old and feeble, though full of intrigue. In
the valley of Marungá is a place called Neyátt, where he established himself
with about twenty families of Kashmiris and others, who had followed him
from Guraiz. His two brothers were also with him. Where he fixed his
residence there is—at some distance below—a village of the name of
Gôsher, inhabited by the people of Takk. The valley is called Karúngá at
its exit. In these two years he cultivated his fields and the friendship of
the Chilásis. Purchasing also cattle and horses he became a great chief,
to whom the Chilásis used to pay visits of ceremony. He also used constantly
to visit them, and when he had acquired a decisive influence, he
assembled all the Lumberdars of Chilás and said, “What a pity that Astór
being so near, whose inhabitants are all Shiahs, you should not attack them
according to the Shera’ [religious Law].” The ignorant Chilásis then began
to go on plundering excursions in the direction of Astor, which were often
successful. When the Governor of Astór became unable to resist these
attacks, he requested the assistance of the Maharaja of Kashmîr, who
refused it to him, but himself advanced direct on Chilás with an army.
(In this war I was present for about a month.) One day a battle began in
the early morning and lasted till the evening. The Maharaja’s army drove
us right into the Chilás Fort. We sent off men at once in all directions
for help. For two days there was no other engagement. On the 3rd day
came allies of the valley of Gîne, from Darêl, Jalkôt, Takk and Torr,
Harbànn, Shatiál, Sazín, Hudúr, Kóli, and 200 Tangîris (we were in all
about 20 “thousand” men, women and children, in that great fort<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>). They
poured in all day, and by evening the struggle was renewed in which, as I saw
myself, women took part. As the Sikhs were pressing on to the walls, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
women threw bedsteads and planks on their heads; stones and kitchen-utensils
were also used. The result was not decisive. A stream was flowing
into the fort in which we had four reservoirs kept filled in case of need.
Hêmur, a brave man, whose son Sadur is now a Chief, a Yashkunn,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> sat
there giving a pumpkin full of water (about half a pint) to a man during
the day and a pint at night, as it was more quiet then. There was a row
of men stationed handing the gourd in and out and taking care that nobody
got more than his share. Often we went without food for two days. The
Chilási women cooked and cast bullets—the other women chiefly fought.
The besiegers diverted the stream from the fort into the valley. We then
drank the water of the reservoirs. This lasted for a month. We only lost
in killed about three or four a day, as we fought behind cover. The
enemy lost from 80 to 120 a day as they were in the open plain. When
their provisions failed and supplies did not reach them, they retired with
the loss of a third of their army, their treasury and goods. (300 women
were appointed for the purpose of working and casting bullets all day.) In
the day time we used to exchange shots—at night we would attack their
camp, when they were tired or asleep. The walls were loopholed for the
guns, and altogether the management of the affair was very good. We
looted 100 mule-loads of powder: as much of lead, 40 tents—100 beds
(charpoys), 2 boxes filled with money (Chilkis<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>)—50 sound muskets and 150
injured muskets,—120 brass kettles—50 brass jugs—200 sheets and 400
brass gharras (pitchers)—100 shawls, good and bad—200 Chaplis
(sandals)—20 chairs—5 loads of sticks—200 lances—200 bayonets—a
heap of 100 swords—20 daggers—20 iron hammers, 130 tent pegs of iron
and 800 of wood—2 big guns—3 field guns, and miscellaneous property
too numerous and various to detail. Two days after the flight of the
Dogras the people assembled and began to divide the spoil. We began by
giving 10 Chilkis to each man, but it did not last for all; so, whoever got
no money, took a gun, lance, tent, etc. The big guns were put into the
fort. I was shot in the leg in that siege. We used to bury our dead in
their clothes within two or three days of their death. The Sikhs also used
to burn, and the besieging Muslims in their service to bury, the dead for
some time. When, however, the casualties increased, the besiegers gave
up attending to the dead. It was in the midst of summer; so the stench
was very great and disease also spread in the Sikh camp. Seven days
after the flight of the enemy, the tribes who had come to help left for their
own places. The following is the list of the Sirdars killed in the siege:
Deyûri Khan, a Shîn, one-eyed, Sirdar of Chilás; Hashm Shah, a Shîn, of
Chilás; Nasr Ali Khan, a Yashkunn, of Chilás; Malik Faulád, a Yashkunn,
of Harbenn. The following Sirdars survived: Rahmat Ulla, Shîn,
Chilási; Akbari, Shîn, Lamberdar of Takk; Murad Shah, Yashkunn of
Tòrr; Adam Shah, Yashkunn of Tòrr; Bahádur (Baghdúr), Shîn of Harbánn;
Naik Numa, a Kamìn, Harbann; Faizulla Khan, Shîn, Harbann;
Mard Shah, Kamìn of Shatiál; Shah Jehán, Kamìn of Shatiál; Malek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Nazr-ud-din, Shîn of Sazin; Hajem Khan, Shîn of Sazin; Lala Khan,
Yashkkunn of Dareyl; Jeldár, Yashkkunn of Dareyl; Izzat, Shîn of
Phúgotsh (Dareyl); Rahmi, Shîn of Samagiál in Dareyl; Matshar Khan
(a great Sirdár) Shîn, Samagial; Losîn, Shîn of Barzîn; Mirza Khan, Shîn,
Barzîn; Shah Merdán, Shîn of Hudúr; Kazilbik, Yashkunn of Búder.</p>

<p>After a year had passed, the Chilasis and the Yaghistánis<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> assembled at
Chilás with the intention of plundering Astór, whose Governors then was
Jabr Khan and Wazir Gurbúnd, subjects of Kashmîr and of the Shiah
faith, and therefore fit objects for the attack of orthodox Mussulmans
(Sunnis). We were in all about 108,000 Yaghistanis (the ideas of number
are very vague in those countries—though not so vague as in Lughmáni
where there is not a separate name for a number above 400, and the foreign
appellation of <i>hazár</i> = 1,000 is the equivalent for 400. <i>Vide</i> Lughmáni and
Kandiá Vocabularies in which numeration is by twenties). The Astóris
were only 6,000, but we went in large numbers, as we counted on having
to meet the Dogras of Kashmir.</p>

<p>The following is the List of the confederate Yaghistanis: From Koli,
1,000; Palus, 4,000; Jalkót, 3,000; Sazin, 500; Shatiál, 500; Harbann,
1,000; Takk, 1,000; Chilas, 3,000; Torr, 1,000; Tangir, 4,000; Dareyl,
10,000; Gôrdjan, 5,000 (probably Gôr); Gîne, 100; Bûder, 100; Gormâni,
2,000 (probably auxiliaries from Gauhar-Amán, the ruler of Yasin,
popularly called Gôrmán); Gilgit, 5,000; Sai, 5,000.</p>

<p>(This only brings the allied Dard forces up to 48,200, perhaps only
19,000, as already explained. Since then the Dards have been more than
decimated, and the destruction of Gilgit with all its traditions, etc., is
one of the saddest results of the Kashmir frontier war. There are, however,
Gilgit emigrants to be found in Sazîn and other places.) We marched
on to the mountains of Astor and Gauhar-Amán with 2,000 men stopped
at Jalkôt (j as in French) in the Sái territory, 6 koss far. He told us that
when the Dogras came up to assist Astor, he would at once advance with
more troops to that place. When we came near Astor, the Governor was
informed of our approach. Most of the Astoris fled, many leaving their
property behind. The 6,000 fighting men remained; they had, however,
sent most of their property away. The people of the Astor village, Dashkin,
had not heard of our arrival; so we surprised it about midnight, killed
2 men and wounded 9—100 were captured (men and women). We took
80 cows, 500 goats, clothes to the value of 400 Rupees, 40 hatchets, 100
swords, and 100 muskets. Out of the house of the Wazîr Gorbúnd we got
8 kettles. There are many Yashkunns at Astor, three-fourths being of that
race and the remainder being half Shîns and the other half Kamíns.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Our
arrival at Astor was announced by a man whom with his companion we
surprised seated at the bridge of Sugarkôt. A man of Shatiál killed the
companion by throwing a stone at him; the other effected his escape and
enabled the Astoris to get away with their property. The reason why we
killed so few was because we wanted to make the people our slaves, either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to keep or sell; being Kafirs their lives are forfeited to the Mussulmans,
but it is harder on them to be slaves than die and therefore we prefer to
enslave them. Besides it is more profitable. In the morning a rumour of
the approach of the Maharajah’s troops reached us. We were greatly surprised
at this and retired on to Hashu Gher (probably the Atsho pir, a
very high mountain which overlooks Bunji, on the Kashmir side of the
Indus) by the Burderikôt road—a very difficult one—on the way to Chilás,
which we reached only the 6th day after our retreat. We then divided the
spoil. Some sold their slaves in Chilás. Most took them to their homes.
We did not lose any one in killed or wounded on this excursion. Jabar
Khan of Astor then went to the Maharaja as a suppliant—saying he and
his people were children and subjects of Kashmir and implored help
against the marauders, who, he urged, should themselves be attacked and
punished. The Maharaja advised him to be quiet for a year, as he would
then bring a large army. This was satisfactory for Jabar Khan, who was
intent on revenge. In fact, 14 months later, when he and his minister
with 60 men again presented themselves at Srinagar, in order to urge the
fulfilment of the promise, 50,000 men (!!) were sent to Chilás. I was
then at Minôr in the Gilgit territory, but my father and brother went into
the war and it is from them that I have heard the following particulars.
When the Sikh General (whose name I forget) reached the Kashmîr river
[the Kishnganga (?)] he divided the Army into two parts—one to go by
way of Guraiz, the other by the Darau valley which goes straight to Chilas
and actually reached Takk. [From Takk there are 2 valleys—the one of
Babuserr; the other of Marungâ.] The reason of the division of the forces
was that the Kashmîr troops feared to trust their whole body into mountainous
country where they might all be cut up. Two days before the
enemy came, we were at Sîhil, below Takk, 1,000 strong. The Yaghistanis
were collecting at Chilás, but most were still on the roads or starting from
their homes. The news of the approach of the Maharajah’s troops had
also frightened away most of the tribes. Indeed there were only 500
besides the force at Sîhil. The following came: 100 from Sazîn, 200 from
Harbán, 40 from Chitrál, 60 from Dareyl, 40 from Jalkôt, 100 from Tangîr,
200 from Tórr, 40 from Hudúr, 200 from Takk, 100 from Bûder. 800
had collected in Gôr, but never came up, but were at Talpènn on the other
side of the Indus, 4 kôs from Chilas. The following Chiefs came: Nazar
Khan, Kasîm and Masta Khan of Sazîn. The 2 former were Shîns, the
other a Yashkunn. Ravîn, a Yashkunn of Shatial; Der Jihan, Kamin, of
Shatial; Alangîr, Kamin, of Harbann; Tapa Khan, Kamin, of Harbann;
Jeldar Mama and Sheithing of Dareyl, Shins; Ametî, Yashkunn, Jalkôt;
Keremo, Shin, Khairulla, Yashkunn, Tangîr; Marat Shah Mama, Adam
Shah, Great Sirdars of Torr, Shins; Shahmard Kaka and his brother of
Hudûr, Shins; Akbari and Azád, Kamins, of Takk; Kizilbîk of Bûder,
Yashkúnn; Sadar Khan, Yashkúnn, Gôr; Wazîr Khan, Yashkúnn, Gôr;
Ramanni, Yashkúnn, Gôr; Rahmat ulla Khan, Nasir Ali, and Hasham
Shah, Yashkúnns, Chilás.</p>

<p>When the Sikh troops came to the bridge of Sîhil, it was 6 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> (before
dawn). We were in ambush and rushed upon them sword in hand. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
was great fighting till the evening—such as had never been before in
Yaghistan. When night broke in, we were beaten and fled back into the
mountains. Then two Sirdars, Ameti Khan and Ser Endáz Khan of
Jalkót, rushed in alone on the army of the infidels and after killing some
were cut down. Ameti’s body fell into the water below the bridge and
came up again after one month at Jalkót on the river side, where Jalkót
is. A boatman of the name of Mehr Gul, came to the place but did not
recognise the body. He told the villagers, who went out with Mira Khan,
the uncle of Ametí, who had not gone to the wars as he was very old.
Ametí’s wife too went to the bank. Nobody recognised the corpse, when
the wife knew him from his pijámas. He was buried and a shrine was
built over his body, which is known by the name of the “shrine of the
martyr.” Ametí had said when about to charge the Sikhs that “if he
should be killed his body would still get to Jalkôt and be buried there.”
Many Sirdars testify to this. During the night, the enemy sleeping from
fatigue, Mulla Shemshêr, and Mulla Khandád and the Pir Padishah Mîa,
a great Sayad, rallied the Yaghistanis and told them of the advantage of
assaulting the infidels at night, which was accounted as a twofold righteousness
in this and the next world. When the Yaghis heard this Fatwa
(authoritative manifesto) their courage increased and they attacked the
enemy’s camp in a body. Our men went on slashing at their heads and
other limbs. It was winter and the blood clotted our hands and froze
them to the sword hilts. Rustam and Afrasiab’s wars would be forgotten
as trifles, if I could describe the terrors of that night. The slaughter lasted
all night. As the day approached and showed the smallness of our
numbers we were again defeated and fled from Sihil to Chilás which is at
the distance of 6 kôs (or about 9 miles). We were followed by the enemy.
Whenever they came up to a suitable place, the fight was renewed and
hundreds were killed. At Dasur, Matshuko-Jal and in the valley of Chilás,
there being an open space, a stand was made, especially at the last place,
which we reached at noon and kept our ground fighting till far into the
night (10 o’clock). We were again defeated and fled into the fort, which
was surrounded by the Maharajah’s army. The following days and nights
were occupied in constant fighting. The enemy again cut off the stream.
Then the Yaghis again appointed Hemur to undertake the distribution of
water from the reservoirs and made the women cook and cast bullets for
them, as during the first siege. This siege, however, was greatly protracted—the
water became scarce and whilst formerly a man would get three
gourdsful (two during the night and one in the day) now only one gourdful
was distributed during the whole twenty-four hours. This lasted for three
months. At night assaults were made and shots were exchanged during
the day through the loopholes. When the enemy approached under the
walls, stones, etc., etc., were thrown on him. We did all we could, but
were still beaten—the reason God alone knows. Oh God! when the
water became scarce, the enemy also put poison into the reservoirs; so
some died from thirst and many from poison. When the enemy saw this,
he had recourse to another <i>ruse</i>. They tied stems of trees together with
ropes and using them as ladders, tried to mount on the fort, firing all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
day. We had not seen this before and in our surprise lost more men than
perhaps was necessary in defending ourselves. Neither water nor an
escape was destined for us; so the remainder consulted about evacuating
the place and getting into the hills. At midnight two-thirds of the men,
taking the women and children with them, left the Fort and began to fly.
The voices of the children roused the blood-thirsty enemy, who, like a wolf,
came after the lambs. Some of the Sikhs entered the Fort and killed those
they found; when they became exhausted with murdering, they took about
680 men, women and children as prisoners for the Sikh General and 120
were destined for the revenge of Jabar Khan and taken away with their
property. The fort was at once set on fire and burnt down. Such property
as they could take they did take. As for the fugitives, it was a
running slaughter till sunrise, when we reached Kitshóri. Here we rallied
and renewed the fight. Kitshóri is 2 kôs below Chilas and is a village on
the Indus. Our men fought, hungry and tired though they were, till noon
and were considerably thinned in numbers. It seemed now useless to us
to continue the fight, for we said that we should all be at last overpowered
and cut down to a man. We must therefore flee. We, therefore, retraced
our march in the direction of the mountains and were not followed up, as
the enemy did not perhaps, think it worth while, our numbers being so
reduced. The pursuers returned to the Chilás fort. When they got there
they agreed to return to Kashmir. As they reached the place where the
two roads branch off, [one for Astor, the other for Kashmîr] the Sikh
General gave leave to Jabar Khan, who took his prisoners with him. All were
in great joy. The following is the list of the Sirdárs who escaped the slaughter:
Alengir, Habba Khan, and Mîr Matta, of Harbenn; Rahmi, of Darêl.</p>

<p>Aladdin of Shatial and Ahmeti and Sir Andaz of Jalkôt were killed; also
Azur, and Alahmun of Sazîn. Mard Shah Baba of Torr got away. Azad
of Takk was killed. Nasr Ali, Hashm Shah, Paulad and Anwarí of Chilas
were all killed. They were all Yashkunns. Serrkushu of Tangir was
killed. M...... of Somer, a Shîn, my cousin, was killed by a bullet going
through his mouth. 500 were killed and 800 taken prisoners—200
escaped. Among the prisoners was Sirdar Rahmat Ulla Khan, who was
sent to Jammu. When he was captured, a Sikh went into the fort after his
daughter, who threw herself off the walls in order to escape disgrace and
was dashed to pieces on a stone. There is no doubt that we were the first
to be in fault, as we attacked Astor without provocation and at the instigation
of Lassu seven times before the Maharaja went to war with us. I
never joined these plundering excursions but my cousin, M......, went
every time and also S......, my brother, who is still alive. Once they
brought back a man and 6 women to Minôr—the whole razzia having
secured 60 prisoners, 800 goats, etc. Thinking it was “halál” or lawfully
acquired property, they divided it with great glee and they ate the goats
also as “halál,” as they had taken them from Shiahs.</p>

<p>There is a suspicion that Lassu was an agent of Kashmîr sent to foment
this discord and bring about the subjection of Chilás. In former times we
used to assist Astor, being our neighbour. There is also no difference in
our language. That of Khapul (Khapolór) is different. It is Tibetan:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
they call a man “shîshek” and for “go there” say “gaz yut” and
“bakhmula gihrit” (there is a mistake here) and for “bury” say “sùmduk”
and for “does he go or not” “yidd mitt.” “Son” they call “bhúman.”
[Some of the words are Kashmîrî.] I remember these words, having once
known the language, as a woman of Khapul, called Miriam, had fallen to
the lot of my brother in the division of the booty. A neighbour of mine
also had a slave of the same place called Kolitsh, who used to come to see
us. I was very young then and could converse with both. A year after,
my brother, in consequence of his greed for money, took her to Kami, a
village of Tangîr and sold her to Batret Shah, Sirdar, the son of Babar
Shah, for 8 tolas of gold (each tolah of the value of 9 Rupees 5 annas).
This was a good price as she was very good-looking, but she should not
have been sold.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the Kashmîr troops attacked Chilas, Lassu joined us secretly and
although himself old and feeble told us what to do—but his two brothers
and two nephews openly fought on our side in the battle of the valley of
Chilás. Indeed at Sihil, Lassu fought himself and used to send the Sirdars
forward with his instructions. In short, as far as he was able, he tried to
injure the Sikhs. When the Sikhs had cut the water off the fort, he had
arranged about putting only one man in charge of it and fixed the rate at
which it should be distributed. He was ever ready with advice. He used
to allow the Sikhs to beat up supplies in villages and then would cut them
up while encumbered with them. This is how we managed to be fed (the
plundered supplies reaching us by a mountain road) for three months. A
relative of Lassu was in the Sikh Camp and told the General about Lassú’s
doings. The attention of the besiegers was then directed towards capturing
him, but in vain, and in both wars he escaped being taken prisoner
or receiving a wound. His younger brother was shot in the palm of the
hand. In short, after the conquest of Chilas, Lassu again resided with his
brothers at Neyátt and kept up his visits to Chilas. When the Sirdars
arranged to offer their submission to the Maharaja at Jammu, they sent for
Lassu and asked him to help them to recover their friends and relatives
who had been taken prisoners to Kashmir. Lassu refused on the ground
that he had left the Maharajah’s service and had been his bitter enemy ever
since and that therefore his life was not safe if he ventured into his presence.
Finally, Lassu was prevailed upon to go. The following Sirdars went to
Jammu to ask for forgiveness: Hashm Shah, Sattari, Baland Khan, and
Daria Khan, of Chilas, with 36 Botés (poor people); Buyedad, Daru Khan,
and Mir, Shîns of Bûder; Azad and Sakhi, Shîns of Takk; Tatari, Kamìn,
and Baghdùr, Shin, also of Takk.</p>

<p>When the Maharaja saw the suppliants, and also noticed Lassu, it was
as if an arrow had pierced him. He was greatly indignant, having heard
everything from his General about Lassu often defeating his troops and
being the origin of the wars and of the numerous plans by which his soldiers
had been destroyed by thousands—for instance at the ambush at Sîhil.
Finally after a long talk, the Maharaja made the forgiveness of the Chilasis
conditional on the execution of Lassu. The Chilasis said “By all means,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
if this man and his ancestors have not been your servants. You expelled
him and we received him. In gratitude for this he may have given us
sometimes advice, but he has never raised his hands against you. Had he
not given us even advice <i>we</i> should have killed him. It was his duty to
do so. Let His Highness therefore pardon him.” The Maharaja refused,
and ordered his General to strike off his head there and then, put the blood
into a plate and give it to him to drink [this was probably meant metaphorically,
as a Hindu would not drink blood, especially not that of a
Muhammadan. However, the Chilasi Chiefs appear to have understood
the threat literally]. The Sirdars all interposed as they could not witness
his death. They offered to pay taxes, if he were spared. [This was
probably the object of this comedy.] Then the Maharaja fixed an annual
tribute of Rs. 2 per house, in lieu of the blood of Lassu. The Chiefs
thought it too much for their poor people, so at last one Rupee per house
was settled. He then dismissed them, but wanted them again to appear
next year with the tribute, viz. Balang Khan, Deryá Khan, Matshar and
Lassu. “When this is done, he added, I will send Lassu with a khilat<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> to
Guraiz and re-instate him as Governor and you shall also receive presents.”
This was accepted and the Chiefs returned with all the people (men, women
and children) who had been taken prisoners. He also sent a letter to
Jabar Khan of Astor to restore the 120 prisoners whom he had taken to
the Chilas Chiefs. This was done and nearly all returned, excepting the
few that had died in course of nature. Thus was Chilas again re-peopled
and is inhabited to the present day.</p>

<p>The following villages in Chilas became subject to Kashmir: Chilas,
then 300 houses, now only 200, 100 having died out in consequence of
disease brought on by the bad water of that place, Bûder, 120 houses,
Takk, 131 houses. The rest did not submit, nor will they ever do so, as
they have heard about the tyranny and oppression practised in Kashmir.
We Yaghistanis have thus become even greater enemies than before, but
are helpless. To revert to my story. After a year the following Sirdars
went with the tribute to Srinagar, viz.: Deryá Khan, Balang Khan, Satari,
Rahmat-ulla, Matshar and Lassu. The Maharaja gave each a present of
120 Rupees and made them stay a month at Jammu. Lassu was sent with
much honour to Guraiz and reinstated. On the expiration of the month
the Sirdars came to Srinagar and requested leave to go as the harvest-time
had come near. The Maharaja received them kindly and requested that
in future two Chilasis should come with the tribute and remain for a year
as servants (really hostages) when they would be allowed to return and two
others be appointed in their stead. The hostages were to receive some pay
from the Maharaja. The Sirdars then returned each to his own village. This
arrangement is still in force. (For a more chronological account of the conquest
of Chilás <a href="#CHRONOLOGICAL_SKETCH">vide Historical Sketch, page 72</a>.)</p>

<h3>II.—WAR WITH GOUHAR AMAN FOR THE POSSESSION OF GILGIT.</h3>

<p>A year later, the same Sikh General was despatched with 3,000 horse
and foot to Astor and fixed a tribute of one-third of the produce on all.
He also established a Thanna at Sógar, a village close to Astor. At the
Thanna he laid in ammunition, etc. Next year he went down with his
troops along the river of Astor to the Indus and established a Thanna at
Bûnji, which is on this side of the Indus and opposite to Sai. Duru was
at that time Governor of Bunji on behalf of Gouhar Aman, the ruler of
Yasin and Gilgit. He also crossed the Indus at Sai and arranged for a
Thanna at Jalkôt, but the Sai country was subject to Gouhar Aman who
was residing at Gilgit. When he heard of the encroachments of Kashmir
he sent off men to Dareyl and Tangîr, asking these tribes to come down on
the Sikhs by the mountain paths near Bunji, whilst he would take the road
along the Indus and attack Sai. He stated that as he and they were
Sunnis, a Jihád [religious war] on the Sikhs became their common duty.
5,000 young men from Dareyl and Tangîr at once collected and came
down to Bunji in 10 days. Gouhar Aman with 3,000 Gilgiti horse and
2,000 coolies, fell on Sái at 2 o’clock in the afternoon of the day on which
the mountaineers reached in the morning. The following Yaghistani
Chiefs came: From Dareyl—Kalashmir, Lala Khan Izzetti, Bira Khan,
Muhammad Khan, Shaithing, Jaldár; from Tangir—Khairulla, Mansûr,
Rustami, Nayûn.</p>

<p>The only son of Gouhar Aman who came was Mulk Aman—Gouhar
Aman himself being detained at Minôr by illness. The following also
came: From Nómal 200 men, from Bhagrôt 2,000(!!), from Sakwal 100,
and from Minôr 200. These men carried loads of provisions and
ammunition. They reached the Niludár range on that day, one kos from
the Sai District. Thence preparations were made for an attack—the Sikhs
having 8,000 men—the battle began at Chakarkôt which is three kôs from
the Indus. There is a field there under cultivation where the fight began.
It was summer. The Sikhs had got into the Chakarkôt Fort which was
surrounded by the Gilgitis. Mulk Aman dashed into it with his horsemen.
The Chakarkoti villagers facilitated their entry and opened the gates for
him. The fight lasted all day and night within and without the Fort. The
Sikhs were defeated; most were killed fighting and some jumped off the
walls and were dashed to pieces. 100 only escaped crossing the river
[Indus] back to Bunji. Gouhar Aman only lost 60 horsemen and 40
Dareylis and Tangîris, also Sirdar Muhammad Khan, a Shin of Darêl.
Mulk Aman did not cross over to Bunji and dismissed the mountaineers,
telling them, however, to be in readiness for renewed fighting. He then
returned to Gilgit. A curious circumstance occurred with two Sikhs who
were taken away as prisoners by the Dareylis. In taking them over the
Jámu rocks,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> which on account of their difficulty, we call “ákho” (Atsho?),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
one fell into the Indus and was never again seen, whilst the other slipped
down and rose again to the surface—an event never known to occur with
any one who falls into the Indus at that place where it is very rapid. He,
however, made his way over to Bunji, and just as he was reaching it, a
stone fell on his head and he was drowned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A year had scarcely elapsed after the battle of Chakarkòt, when, in the
spring, about 20,000 Kashmir troops with the former General came to
Astor. He sent a letter of defiance to Gauhar Aman, challenging him to
do his worst, to assemble the mountaineers and to meet him on an open
plain. Gauhar Aman at once told the mountaineers that they should
quietly get into Jalkot (Sai District) by way of the valley of Kámberi, over
the mountain Hudurga, to the village Kirinjot, and get out by the mountains
of Puhût. This was done. Gauhar Aman again fell ill at Minôr.
His son just got there in time to meet the Sikhs (10,000 in number) near
the Niludar, the mountain ridge which is between Gilgit and Sai. It was
night, and so both armies encamped; in the morning the fight began.
7,000 Dareylis and Tangîris had come under Jeldar, and Lala Khan of
Gaya in Dareyl and Izzetí, Pátsha Khan of Phogutsh of Dareyl—also
Matshar Khan of Samagiál—Bitori, Kalashmir of another Samagial, Kusuti
of Manekyál, Arzennu of Dareyl—Rústami, Kâmi of Tangîr, Muhammad
Mir, Adab Shah of Gali, Khairulla of Jagôt—Karim, Moya Shah, Mawêshi,
Matti of the Deyamur village—Merdumi of Lúrak—Akbaro of Sheikho—[2,000
came from Tangir, 5,000 from Dareyl]. Gouhar Aman’s son had
3,000 infantry and 6,000 horsemen. The Sikhs were on the roads below
the mountains, whilst the Yaghistanis were firing from the tops. The
Sikhs necessarily wasted their shot in such an encounter, whilst the
mountaineers had it all their own way. This lasted the whole day. All
(10,000!!) were destroyed—only one sepoy escaped to Bunji to tell the
news to the other half of the army. The General was not present in this
as in the Chakarkót battles, but stayed at Bunji. The Yaghis only lost
2 men, one from Phúgutsh and the other from Samagial, viz.: Shahbaz,
also called “Osmin,” and Uzet Shah. The mountaineers then accompanied
the victorious army back to Minôr and Gilgit, where they consulted
regarding the future safety from the Sikhs. Gauhar Aman thought that the
Gilgit Fort could not stand a siege and that it should therefore be
strengthened and the walls made higher. This view was shared by the
mountaineers who looked upon Gilgit as their centre: so they all set to
work to improve the fort and raised it twenty yards in height and gave six
yards of depth to the walls. Bullocks were constantly treading down the
stones as the walls were being raised. The Zamindars also helped. The
Mountaineers assisted and were fed during the month that it took to
strengthen the place. Then all left, when Gauhar Aman fell very ill. He
sent Mulk Aman, with 5,000 horsemen against Yasin to fight Mahtar and
A’smat Shah, sons of Suleyman Shah, descendants of Pátsha (?), Shins.
They came there on the fourth day and surrounded the place. Mahtar
would not fight, and surrendered on the tenth day, saying that they all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
came from one stock and were subjects to Gauhar Aman. A’smat Shah
fled to Swat. Mahtar paid his respects with 1,000 young men and was
apparently received in a friendly manner by Mulk Aman, who said he
wanted to talk to him privately. There is a hall for the princes 100 yards
from the Fort, and to this he led Mahtar and after a conversation of two
hours struck off his head. Then he came out and killed 20 of Mahtar’s
relatives and friends. The rest he put into the Fort, as they were merely
Zamindars. He then asked Gauhar Aman to come to Yasin with his whole
family. On the good news reaching him he assembled the Gilgitis and
told them that, as his illness was sure to carry him off, he wanted to be
buried in his own country where also his ancestors reposed. In reality, he
wanted to marry the widow of Mahtar. When he came near Yasin, some
one told him that his son had married the widow. This rendered him
furious and made him think of killing his son. In this state of mind he
reached Yasin, where he said nothing but ascertained that the widow had
been married eight days ago. He then threw Mulk Aman into a prison
which was at the top of the highest tower of the Yasin fort and ordered
that he should not receive sufficient food. The woman was also placed
under surveillance. He left Ghulam as Wazir of Gilgit. Gauhar Aman
remained ill for a year, being unable to move and one side being shrivelled
up. When he felt his death nigh, he released Mulk Aman and made the
woman over to him. A few days after he died and Mulk Aman had
accomplished the funeral rites, he ascended the throne. When Isa Baghdùr
[Isa Bahádur] and the fugitive A’smat Shah heard this in Swat, they
rejoiced as they did not think that Mulk Aman was a hero like his father.
Isa Bahadur of Sher Kila’ had also fled to Swat having heard of the defeat
of the Sikhs and being afraid of being dispossessed by Gauhar Aman—an
idea which was confirmed by Akbar Aman, the brother on the father’s side
of Gauhar Aman—(Isa Bahadur and Akbar were cousins, sons of two
sisters) (Isa Bahadur and Gauhar Amán were tarburs ‎‏تربور‏‎, namely brothers’
children). There is a road from Swat to Yasin which is much used and is
near. Mulk Aman, wishing to conquer other countries, enquired who had
caused Isa Bahadur’s flight and offered a reward for the information.
Hayátulla, a servant of Gauhar Amán, told him a month after about his
uncle being the cause, as they were related on the women’s side (the
stronger tie; being related on the father’s side is not a strong bond wherever
polygamy is common). This convinced Mulk Aman, for having taken the
throne from his uncle to whom it by right belonged, he always felt suspicious
of him. However, he kept his own counsel, when one day he invited Akbar
Aman to go out shooting with him. They went about one kôs from the
Yasîn fort, where a fine plain comes in view. Mulk Aman advised all
retainers to get down from their horses as he wanted to rest a little and
then start the game which would come in sight in that place. This they
did not do, so he jumped from his horse, pretending that he saw game in
different directions and ran after it. Then Akbar Aman also got down
from his horse. He had scarcely moved about for a few yards, when a
ball, fired by Mulk Aman, struck him dead. Mulk Aman then returned
to govern in peace of mind. This news Isa Bahadur had also heard in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Swat. What with wishing to revenge Akbar and thinking of the confusion
which would be sure to follow the discord of the brothers of Mulk Aman
(Mîr Wali, Pahlivan, etc.) he and Asmár got ready and came back—but I
don’t know whether he came <i>via</i> Kandiá [a hitherto unexplored District,
referred to elsewhere] or by what road. Anyhow he appeared at Sai with
the 20 followers whom he had taken with him from Sher Kila’ on his flight.
There he found Sultan, the ex-Wazir of Pohordu Shah, a descendant of the
Queen Johari (Jowâri—<a href="#Page_22"><i>vide</i> 1st Song, page 22</a>) who in ancient times was
the ruler of Sai and whose descendants had fled from Gauhar Aman into
the hills. When Gauhar Aman died, all these fugitives came back and so
Sultan turned up at Sai. When Isa and Asmat met him they contracted
an alliance by oath and went together to Jammu by way of Astor in order
to offer their services to the Maharajah. Indeed, they offered their
allegiance, if he would help them with troops. The Maharajah made them
swear on the Koran, because he said, “your religious bigotry may induce
you to turn on me and induce you to be again friends with Mulk Aman.
Besides, you all belong to one family and I alone shall be the loser.”
Then they all agreed and he made them swear on the Koran, after getting
them to wash themselves first; “that they would never ally themselves or
be subject to any one but the Maharaja and consult nobody’s interests but
his.” The three swore most solemnly and assured H. H. that he need not
be under any anxiety in future regarding his army and their own movements.
They then asked leave in order to avail themselves of the dissensions
of the brothers and prevent their becoming friends again. Then
H. H. sent 6,000 infantry and 4 guns (mule-batteries) with Isa, Sultan and
Asmat—Rs. 200 cash were given to Isa and a dress of honour; Rs. 100
and a gun to Sultan and Rs. 120 and a horse to Asmat Shah. The
Maharaja recommended them always to keep the garrisons at Astor and
Bunji, which were each 5,000 strong, at half their strength and to take the
rest in order to prevent surprises and the loss of places which were difficult
to acquire and to reduce to taxation. He thus allowed them to take 11,000
troops with them in all—<i>viz.</i> 6,000 men whom he sent direct and 5,000
from the garrisons of Astor and Bunji. Thus they started with the General
and the Jítan Sahib (Adjutant?) for Astor. There they remained a month
to see whether the roads ahead were safe. They sent a Kashmiri, called
Abdulla, into Yaghistan, <i>via</i> Sai, Minôr, Gilgit, Yasin, Dareyl, Tangîr,
Hunza, Nagyr, etc., to enquire what the tribes were doing and going to do.
He went to Gilgit and instead of fulfilling his mission himself, he sent
Norôz, a Zemindar and a subject of Mulk Aman, who, of course, went to
Yasin and told Mulk Aman all he had heard from Abdulla and that Isa
and his allies were advancing. On his return he told Abdulla that he had
seen the tribes, that they had no idea that anything was impending and
that Isa might advance with safety at once. Abdulla returned to Astor,
whilst Mulk Aman summoned the Darêl and Tangîr tribes, saying that
unless they fought now they would lose their country. He also sent a
messenger to Ghazanfar, Raja of Hunza and one to Shah Murad, Wazir of
Nagyr (?) telling them to forget their enmity with him in the advance of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
common foe to their country and religion (although the people of Hunza
and Nagyr are Shiahs, necessity made Mulk Aman, a Sunni, call them
Mussulmans) and asking them to meet him with their young men at Gilgit.
Ghazanfar promised to come on the ninth day and asked him to go ahead.
Mulk Aman, however, waited nine days and when nobody came, he
advanced with the friendly hill tribes of Darêl and Tangîr to Gilgit. Isa
Bahadur and his allies, altogether 9,500 men, started from Astor, 2,500
soldiers joined them at Bunji and they all advanced to within the distance
of one kôs from the Gilgit Fort, which they surrounded. Wazir Zoraveru
commanded in this war on the part of the Sikhs—there were also Sirdar
Muhammad Khan of Swat, the Sirdar Jitani (Adjutant) and others whose
names I forget. On behalf of the tribes there were: (1) from <span class="smcap">Dareyl</span>:
Lalá Khan, Jeldár Bura Khan of Gayá—with 1,000 Zemindars;—Izzeti
and Muhammad Khan of Phugotsh with 700 Zemindars—Matshar Khan
and Mahman from Karini (lower) Samegial with 1,000 men—Mirza Khan
and Kalashmir from Upper Samegial and 1,000 men—Kasûti from Karini
Manikyal with 1,000 men—Hamza Khan and Arzennu from Upper
Manikyal and 900 men—Bitori of Yatsho and 40 men—Suryó from Jutyal
and 60 men—Tubyó and Syad Amir of Dudishal and 30 men—altogether
5,846 from Dareyl. (2) from <span class="smcap">Tangir</span>: Mardumì (is still alive), Talipu of
Lurak and 40 men—Moza Shah and Maweshi (still alive) of Dîyamar and
400 men—Khairulla and Mansur (still alive) of Julkôt and 140 Zemindars—Adab
Shah and Mansur (still alive), of Gali and 60 men,—Néyo and
Rustam Khan of Kami (still alive) and 400 men—Multan of Korgah (still
alive) and 60 men—Akbaru of Sheikho and 40 men—altogether 1,153 men
and Chiefs. With Mulk Aman there came from <span class="smcap">Yasin</span>: his brother Mir
Vali Khan, the Wazirs Rahmat and Nasir—Hayatalla, Habib—Padisha
Mia, Balhi, Syad Khan (of Swat) with 100 Pathans—Muhammad Hussain,
a great Chief of Yasin and 10,000 men, horse and foot, from Yasin and
friendly countries.</p>

<p>At the dictation of Pehliwan, son of the sister of Aman-ul-Mulk, ruler of
Chitral or little Kashghár, a messenger of the name Balli—was sent to
Chitrál, saying that Hunza and Nagyr had broken their promise and that,
now that their father was dead, all his enemies had assembled to destroy
them, 11,000 infidels, described as ‎‏كافر نابكار ڈوگره بي اِعتبار‏‎, or useless
unbelievers and perfidious Dogras, had already surrounded Gilgit with the
help of faithless Isa, the fugitive Asmat and the traitor Sultan. “When
we shall be dead, what is the use of you, a relative, striking your forehead
with a stone (as a sign of grief)”? Balli taking forced marches reached
Aman-ul-Mulk speedily, who, at once sent Lakhtar Khan, his nephew, son
of Adam Khor (whom he had caused to be killed) with 8,000 men of sorts
to Gilgit and wrote to promise further help, if Balli were sent again.
Indeed it was said that Aman-ul-Mulk might come himself. So there
advanced to the rescue of Gilgit the united forces of Mulk Aman and the
auxiliaries from Chitrál. Mulk Aman then told the Dareylis and Tangîris
to lay in ambush behind Parmas and Basîn in the valley, as the Sikh troops
were there. He himself at 6 o’clock in the evening went to attack these
places. About 1,000 Sikhs were there, not suspecting any danger, in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
tents. The attack was sudden and 120 were at once despatched to the
lowest regions [of hell]; 100 Sikhs were captured. Then he called out to
his young horsemen that having done so much they should attack the
besiegers and that the infantry would follow them. He himself rode ahead,
thereby inspiring his troops with courage. The enemy was attacked, but
was now ready for them. A fierce struggle began and the Sikhs were forced
on to the fortress with the loss of twenty youths and a loss of three Dareylis
on our side, who had rashly followed the Sikhs into the fort. Then Mulk
Aman halted in front of the fort and attacked it in the early morning and
called out. “If you want to fight, well and good—if not, I will let you
depart for Astor.” Isa Bahadur replied: “We will certainly not do so till
we uproot the foundations of your houses.” Saying this, he fired his
musket and killed Hayatulla (who had been the cause of his uncle’s death).
Then volleys were exchanged. So the fight lasted for a month, during the
day—Mulk Aman retiring to a short distance at night—the Sikhs, however,
picking off stragglers at night also. On the 27th day after the siege, the
Raja of Hunza reached with 12,000 soldiers, but did not join the fight.
6,000 soldiers, in addition to the 8,000 already sent, also came from Chitrál
who, at once, assisted in the siege. There was plenty of wheat which had
been cut and heaped up by the Gilgit Zemindars who had fled at the
approach of the Sikhs. The soldiers of Aman-ul-Mulk would take the
sheaves, crush them with stones and boil them in water. Food was taken
at night. Three days later, when the besiegers still held out, the Chitrál
forces thought of returning. On the last day, Makhsat, a servant of Asmat
Shah, renowned all over Yaghistan as an incomparable hero, came out of
the fort with sword and buckler and called out. “Is there any one who
will fight [me] the mountain eating lion?” Then Balli, the servant of
Mulk-Aman, replied: “Come out and fight with me in the open space, for
brave men do not boast.” So he, snatching a sword and shield, met him.
After boasts and insults on both sides, they closed; but Makhsat’s sword
could only find Balli’s shield to strike, whilst Balli, in protecting himself
always found an exposed part of Makhsat to hit. At last Balli struck a
blow which not only cut through Makhsat’s shield, but falling on his right
shoulder caused the sword to pass out on his left side, thus dividing the
body into two pieces. On seeing this, Mulk Aman considered that a sufficient
victory had been gained and passed on to Yasin, accompanied by the
Allies. Of the prisoners he had captured at Barmas, in order to wreak his
revenge, having been disappointed in taking the Gilgit fort, he selected
twenty four of the officers and ordered them to be executed at Kuffarkôt,
four kôs from Gilgit near the Indus. This was accordingly done by some
men in Lakhtar Khan, the Chitrál General’s army. When their souls had
reached the angels of Hell, Mulk Aman ordered the rest also to be killed,
for, he said, these infidels have made martyrs of many of our friends and
countrymen. Lakhtar Khan interposed on the ground that they were
helpless, now that their officers were dead, and made a claim to carry them
off himself, as a satisfaction for the losses of his army. “I want,” he said,
“to bring them to my country and sell them for red gold to the Tájiks.
Thus I shall obtain compensation for the blood of martyrs that has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
been shed and they will be punished by being sold from place by
the Tájiks.” Then Mulk Aman conferred the desired present on Lakhtar
Khan, but kept one (the only officer who was spared) who was called
“Commandân Bahádur” and presented him to Jaldár Khan of Gayá
(Dareyl), as many martyrs [so called because they were Muhammadans,
who had been killed in the war with the “infidel” Dogras] had fallen from
that District. When the troops had gone back for another kôs (from
Kuffárkôt) to a place called Serga—a very deep valley—Jaldár Khan told
the “Commandán” to come near him, as he was in his charge. He
caught hold of his hand and led him along. He then noticed a talisman
round the Sikh’s neck and wanted to snatch it away, forgetting that he
was exposing himself to an attack by the movement. The “Commandan”
saw a sword hanging on Jaldár’s shoulder, so he let Jaldár take his talisman
and drawing the sword struck off his head. When the Dareylis saw
the death of their chief, they rushed upon the murderer and secured him.
Separating in groups to consult as to the best means of putting him to
death, the people of Gayá (Jaldár’s village) advised his arms and legs
being tied to four horses and his body being torn to pieces by the horses
being set off at a gallop. This proposal was not favourably received by
Khoshál Khan, the brother of Jaldár. The people of Samegiál suggested
that his tongue should be torn out with red-hot pincers, then to flay him
alive, cover his body afterwards with salt and pepper and finally to burn
him and make him over to the ruler of Jahannam [Hell]. This suggestion
being favoured by Khoshál Khan, it was ordered to be carried out.
Thus the “Commandán Bahádur” died. The Dareylis then rushed on
his ashes and half-burnt flesh and taking a handful, secured it in their
clothes as a reminiscence of the event. I have mentioned this affair at
length, because Jaldár was a very celebrated man for his hospitality,
eloquence, good manners and administrative capacity. Rich and poor
obeyed him, for he was wise and his death was a great advantage to the Sikhs.</p>

<p>Mulk Aman set out for Yasin, as I have said, and dismissed the
Yaghistanis. Lakhtar Khan also asked for his leave through Pahliwan,
Mulk Aman’s brother and offered to let the army remain if he himself was
allowed to go. This was permitted and the army remained with Pahliwan,
his mother’s brother (a sister of Adamkhor of Chitrál was Gauhar-Aman’s
wife and Gauhar Aman’s sister was Adamkhor’s wife). The following is
the list of the chiefs killed before Gilgit: [The Sikhs lost 221 killed,
wounded and prisoners.] Wazirs Nuseir and Hayatulla of Yasin; Jaldár
Khan of Gayá (Dareyl); Talîpu of Tangîr; Béra Khan of Gaya; Mirza
Khan of Hunîni Samagiál; Sirdar of Hunîni Samagiál; and Padshah Mia
of Yasin.</p>

<p><i>Dareyl</i> lost 203 Zemindars; <i>Tangîr</i> 101 men; <i>Gakutsh</i> [or <i>Galkûtsh</i>]
50; <i>Tshér</i>, 40; <i>Sherôt</i> 52; <i>Shukoyôt</i> 30; <i>Guluphúr</i> 44. Mulk Aman
lost 160 of his retainers; (altogether 376 of his subjects.) The Chitrális
lost 410, altogether 1,090 were killed on our side. [For a more

<h3>III.—WAR ON YASIN AND THE MASSACRE OF ITS INHABITANTS. [1860]</h3>

<p>When Lakhtar Khan informed the ruler of Chitrál of all that had occurred,
Aman-ul-Mulk sent a messenger to the ruler of Yasin with the advice to
fortify Gakutsh, lest that too should be lost by him and he should be
blamed for not advising him in time. He also thought that the Sikhs
would not advance before they had strengthened their hold on Gilgit.
Therefore he asked for his army to be sent back; next year he promised
to send a larger force, as then an attack from the Sikhs might be possible.
Mulk Aman delayed the messenger for ten days, but sent Sirdar Mustaán,
son of General Hayat-ulla of Yasin, with the Chitrál army to Aman-ul-Mulk.
They were 5,880 horse; 7,720 foot and 12 mules with ammunition. Mulk
Aman then remained at Yasin, feeling quite safe and established a Thanna
of five men at Gakutsh, one day’s march from Yasin, in order to scour the
country and enquire from travellers and Zemindars about the movements
of the Sikhs. He advised them to treat informants well and let him know
in time, lest Aman-ul-Mulk’s warning should come true. The outpost
kept a good look-out, entertained travellers and daily sent in news of the
state of affairs. Five months afterwards Wazir Zoraweru of Kashmir
sent Wazir Mukhtár with twenty young men to Gakutsh to surprise
the Thanna at night, and establish themselves as an outpost and
intercept all travellers from or to Yasin. He also sent after them Sabûr,
a Kashmiri, with ten Hindu Sipahis and Attaì, Kashmiri, with ten
Muhammadan Sipahis, and ordered Attaì to establish himself at 100 yards
above Gakutsh and Sabur at the same distance below Gakutsh and intercept
the roads. Three days afterwards, Zoraweru, Isa Bahadur, Ghulam
Haydar, Mizra Wazir, Baghdur Shah, Zohrab Khan, Asmat Shah and Saif
Ali, the Commandant, with 9,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry, advanced
on Gakutsh. We must now leave them on the road and see what the
surprise party is doing. They came there shortly after mid-night, surrounded
the Thanna and captured the five men. Mukhtar then established
himself as Thannadar and Attaì and Sabûr took up their appointed posts
and captured all travellers of whatever age and sex, sending them in to the
Thanna; in all, three women, four children, two foreign youths and one
Yasini were captured. When the army came to Gakutsh, Zoraweru left
the Thanna as it was, and advanced the same day without stopping, so as
to prevent all notice of his march reaching Yasin before he himself arrived,
marching all night, and at about 4 o’clock came to Chamûgar, a village,
about twenty nine kôs from Yasin. Accidentally, Muhammad Hussain, a
Sayad, had gone out hunting that day. His horse rearing without any
apparent cause he looked round and saw clouds of dust at Chamûgar.
He, at once, suspected what was taking place, galloped back to Yasin and
called out before Mulk Aman’s house: “Why are you sitting at your
ease? the enemy is on you—now do anything if you can.” Mulk Aman
at once got his horses saddled and fled with his family over the mountains
in the direction of Chitrál. When the army came near Yasin, Isa Bahadur,
who knew the country, ordered it to be divided into three corps, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
which marched straight on Yasin—the second to go to the right of Yasin
by the village of Martal and the third to go to the left of the place, so
that the inhabitants should not be able to escape. When the Sikhs
entered Yasin with Asmat Khan preceding them (who got all his friends
and relatives out of the way) acts of oppression occurred which I have
heard related by the people of Kholi and which have never been surpassed
by any nation of infidels. In traditions much is told, but all is nothing
compared with the following atrocities which surpass the doings of demons,
jins and witches. We, say the Kholi informants, with our own sinful eyes
saw these ferocities practised by Mussulmans on Mussulmans. That blood
thirsty Kafir, Isa Bahadur, ordered the houses to be entered and all the
inhabitants, without regard to sex or age, to be killed. We swear that
Isa Bahadur descended from his horse and distinctly ordered the soldiers
to snatch the babes from their mothers’ arms and kill them, so that his
heart might be set at ease. He then put one knee on the ground, putting
his hands on his knees and waiting for the babes. As they were brought
to him, he put one of their small legs under his foot and tore the other
off with his hand. Even the Sikh soldiery could not bear looking on this
spectacle. However, this accursed infidel, (infidel, although he was a
Sunni) kept on tearing them to pieces. The slaughter lasted five days and
nights. The blood of the victims flowed in streams through the roads:
there is not a word of exaggeration in all this. After these dreadful five
days were over, Zoraweru sent for Asmat Shah and enquired after his
relatives, whom he had put in safety. They were brought forward and
Yasin committed to their charge, but what was left of Yasin!?<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Thus
2,000 men, women, and children above ten years of age and a countless
number of infants and babes became martyrs at the hands of the bloody
Sikhs—3,000 persons (chiefly women) a very few children as also a few
old men were kept as prisoners and brought in three days to Gilgit,
Zoraweru being elated with excessive joy which he manifested in various
ways <i>en route</i>. When he came to Gilgit, Isa Bahadur and Asmat Shah,
selecting 1,000 of the more beautiful women, took them to Jammu with
3,000 soldiers. They were so delighted that they took double marches
in order to be early with their good news. At a public assembly at
Jammu, these scoundrels narrated, with much boasting and eloquence, their
own achievements and those of the Sikhs and spoke with the loud tone in
which victories are reported.</p>

<p>When they had finished, the Maharaja asked them whether their hearts
were pleased with all these doings. Isa Bahadur said that all his heart’s
desire had not been accomplished, though he certainly had experienced
a slight satisfaction in the fate of the people of Yasin, who had been his
enemies in the times of Gauhar Aman. “God be praised,” he said, “that
I have lived to revenge myself on them.” The Maharaja enquired what
else there remained to afford him complete satisfaction. “Perhaps,” he
said, “I may be able to meet your views.” Isa Bahadur replied. “Alas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Mulk Aman with all his family has escaped unhurt to Chitrál! I should
have liked to have treated him as the Commandán Sahib who killed Jaldár
was treated, and to have taken his wife for myself and to have killed his
children, as I did the infants of Yasin and, moreover, to burn them. Then
alone will my heart be at ease. However, in consequence of Your Highness’s
good fortune, much has been done. If your shadow only continues
to protect me, I may, some day, be able to have my heart’s desire on Mulk
Aman.” The Maharaja then bestowed on him a splendid and complete
dress of honor, a horse and Rs. 500. He also gave Rs. 100, a dress and
a horse to Asmat Shah. He finally placed the 3,000 soldiers whom he
had brought under his command and made him Governor of Sher Kila
(where he is still). Isa Bahadur, after the usual deprecatory forms of
politeness used at oriental Courts, suggested that, in the midst of Yaghistan,
he would not be able to hold his own even with 30,000 soldiers, unless the
Maharaja placed Pahlivan, the son of the sister of Aman-ul-Mulk at the
head of the Government of Yasin even without troops, as he had all the
prestige of Aman-ul-Mulk on his side. At last, the Lord of Srinagar said
that he agreed to it, if Isa Bahadur could manage to get Pahlivan appointed
to Yasin, a matter which, naturally, was out of his own control. Isa
Bahadur then asked for troops, not against Chitrál, whose interests would
now be conciliated, but against the Dareylis and the other hill tribes. So
the Maharaja gave him the troops, warning him at the same time to be
on his guard against Pahlivan tampering with his troops and so causing
a general revolt against the Maharaja’s authority.</p>

<p>His Highness then ordered Asmat Shah to go to Yasin in order to keep
a watch on the movements of Pahlivan and to inform Wazîr Zoraweru of
all that was going on. Asmat Shah feared that his life would not be safe
at Yasin and wished for some other employment. The Maharaja then
said his salary should be Rs. 40 per mensem<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and he should go with Isa
Bahadur, as Thanadar of Gakûtsh. Isa Bahadur, however, thought that
it could not be done and that it would be better to send him to Basîn.
This was agreed to and the two got ready to depart. The Maharaja
advised him to take the 2,000 prisoners left at Gilgit back with him to
Sher Kila, so that the place might be well populated, a plan that would
not only give him more income from the produce of fields but provide
him with assistance against an enemy. “Leave,” he added, “your first
wife at Gilgit, (as a hostage, no doubt, for Isa’s fidelity to the Maharaja)
and take your second wife and her children with you to Shêr.” So they
returned to Gilgît, Asmat Shah setting up with his family at Basîn, where
he is still and receives his pay. Isa Bahadur also settled at Shêr in the
manner suggested by the Maharaja. He then sent Daulat Shù, a Zemindar
of Gulmutti, eight kôs from Shêr, to Aman-ul-Mulk of Chitrál asking him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
to appoint Pahlivan as Governor of Yasin, who would be quite safe there.
Daulat Shù was sent because he knew the roads and had often gone to
Chitrál. He reached the place in seven days. Aman-ul-Mulk replied that
he could not send Pahlivan, unless Isa Bahadur also agreed to <span class="smcap">Mir Vali</span>
and Wazir Rahmat. He gave Daulat Shù a parting present of a gun,
sword and horse. Daulat Shù told Isa Bahadur of the result of his mission.
Isa at once set off for Gilgit to consult with Zoraweru. He represented to
him that unless Aman-ul-Mulk was allowed to have his way, he himself
could not hold his own at Sher Kila. Zoraweru, upon this, gave him full
permission to act as he liked, taking the responsibility on his own shoulders
in the event of the Maharaja asking any questions, as the only means of
securing some peace. Isa then again despatched Daulat Shù in all haste,
who reached Chitrál in five days, with the message that Aman-ul-Mulk should
do him the favour of sending the three men he had suggested. Aman-ul-Mulk
entertained Daulat Shù for twenty days, during which time he
assembled 2,000 young men and sent them to Yasin with Pahlivan, Mir
Vali and Rahmat. He made those three take an oath on the Koran that
they would never intrigue against each other, “for, if you do, you will fall
an easy prey to Isa Bahadur.” When they reached Yasin, they sent on
Daulat Shù to Isa Bahadur. The first thing they did was to get the
fugitive Yasinis back to their country which they ruled as in former
days. Isa Bahadur was glad at this and gave eight tolahs of gold to the
messenger.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<h3>IV.—WAR WITH NAGYR AND HUNZA. [1864]</h3>

<p>It is now nine years since these wars have taken place or two years after
the conclusion of the war with Yasin. The Maharaja wrote to Zoraweru
that after all what he wanted to conquer were the countries of Nagyr and
Hunza, as there was no profit to be gained from Gilgit and Yaghistan,
whence hitherto, he said, “we have only reaped stony districts and loss
of men,” [in reality, Gilgit and Yasin are fertile, whilst Hunza is “stony”].
Zoraweru at once set out for Nômal, which is twelve kôs from Gilgit in the
direction of Nagyr and sent Mehdîn Khan of Bunair and Sultan Wazir of
the Janheri descendants and Saif Ali, Commandant, with 8,000 infantry.
Zoraweru himself remained at Nômal in order to facilitate communications
and bring up help, if necessary. The army advanced next day to Chaprôt,
Guyétsh and Hini, of which the latter is in Nagyr and the former in Hunza<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and encamped between these places on a plain.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>(?) Guyétsh and Chaprôt
are on the frontier of Hunza. Its inhabitants speak the same language
as the people of Hunza. Hini was on the other side of the army and is
on the frontier of Nagyr. The Chief of Chaprôt is Shah Murad Wazir,
whilst Sirdar Mamal Beg is at Hini and Phagoi, the Lumbardar, at
Guyêtsh, whose son is Shukar Beg, a brave young man. The chief command
of the invading troops was given to Sultan, who had previously sent
a man, Uruz Ali, to the Hunza Raja, to announce his arrival. He told
him to lie in ambush at Nilamutsh in order to destroy the troops under
the other Kashmir Officers. “I will draw off,” he said, “half the army in the
direction of the Valley.” Uruz Ali was by origin a Hunza man who had
settled at Gilgit. The Raja of Hunza acted on the advice thus sent. When
Wazîr Sultan came to Nilamutsh, he started with some youths towards
Chaprôth. Now Nilamutsh is a place so surrounded by inaccessible and
high mountains that escape from an enemy who occupies them is impossible
and even a great army is helpless. No one prevented or questioned
the movements of Sultan, who advanced about one kôs out of Nilamutsh—Mahdin
and Saif Ali now entered the place when they were at once
assailed with stones and bullets on every side by invisible enemies and lost
400 young men killed between forenoon and evening. Two Nagyris
only were wounded, one being shot through the mouth who is still alive
and the other receiving a bullet in his thigh from which he subsequently
died at Nagyr. When the surprised Generals consulted at night on the
events of the day, they inferred from the absence of Sultan and the fact
that he had got safely through Nilamutsh, as well as from the unexpected
presence of the enemy, that treachery had been at work. The reason of
this conduct was that Sultan, although the bravest to fight on behalf of the
Maharaja, had not been rewarded with land as Isa and Azmat had been,
but had remained under the direct orders of Zoraweru, who had put him
forward in the war in order to get him killed and who had poisoned the
Maharaja’s mind against him. “However,” the Generals added, “at present
we must think of getting out of this place; otherwise not a man will remain
alive to tell the news at Nômal.” They then decided, on the suggestion of
Saif Ali, to send two Dareylis, Firôz and Kúweti, into the Hunza lines, as they
might have influence with them, being also Yaghistanis, in order to secure
the safe return of the Army. The task was reluctantly accepted by the
Dareylis whose presence in the Sikh Army naturally compromised them.
However, they went and swore on behalf of the Sikhs that if they were
allowed to depart no future invasion should ever take place. Naudin, the
Wazir of Nagyr and Ghazanfar of Hunza refused, on which the Dareylis
requested that they might be shot and their bodies thrown in the valley, as
a proof that they had done their best and failed in their mission. “We are
Mussulmans and you should forgive us and as a natural consequence those
whom we represent.” The men now prepared for death, when Naudin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
interposed and got their request sanctioned, on the understanding that the
Sikhs would at once return to Gilgit or else he would attack within an hour.
The Kashmir Army, which had been re-joined by Sultan in the meanwhile,
were only too glad to get away on these terms and returned to Nômal. Sultan
gave out that he had gone ahead in order to clear the road in advance.
However, Zoraweru was informed of the treachery, and, at once, put Sultan
in chains and sent him to Jammu with a detailed letter under strict charge
of Sirdars Baghdùr Shah and Ghulam Haidar and ten soldiers.</p>

<p>Zoraweru then took the army back to Gilgit. When the Maharaja read
the letter, from which it appeared that no one except Sultan’s <i>confidant</i>,
Urùz Ali, who, the Gilgitis said, was always going backwards and forwards
to Hunza, could have gone to inform the Hunza people of an attack, which
must have been successful, had they not been forewarned, he condemned
Sultan to imprisonment for life. I think that it was a got-up affair, for
Zoraweru had often and in vain tried to take Hunza-Nagyr. As a proof of
this I may mention that Hilli Shah of Hunza had come to Gilgit a few days
before the expedition to buy merchandise. The Wazîr sent for him, gave
him money and took him into his confidence. Seven days after he asked
Hilli Shah to assist him in an attack on Nilamutsh which he was contemplating
a month hence. Hilli said that he and his brother Mirza Khan, an
artilleryman famous for his bravery and influence, would guide the Sikh
Army through Nilamutsh into Hunza. So they swore to abide by this plan
and the Wazir dismissed him with a present of Rs. 40 and a Lungi. He
also promised great rewards in the event of the success of the expedition.
Hilli Shah told Mirza Khan, who was delighted. Uruz reached Hunza
after Hilli Shah and told the Raja of it, who sent for Hilli Shah and
enquired from him whether he had heard anything at Gilgit about the
movements of the Sikhs or of an attack on Hunza. Hilli Shah said that
he had not been to Gilgit and had heard nothing. However, the Raja
noticed the Lungi which Hilli wore and which Uruz said had been given
by Zoraweru. When he set out to surprise the Sikhs he sent for the
brothers: Mirza Khan came at once, but Hilli Shah hid himself at Gakkarkôt,
five kôs above Hunza. When Ghazanfar returned from the war,
he sent for Hilli Shah. The messenger found him returning from a hunting
expedition and brought him to Ghazanfar who asked him, why he had not
gone to the war against the infidels; “has the Lungi on your head bribed
you?” and added “it is improper that you should live.” He was accordingly
cut into pieces (literally) before the eyes of Mirza Khan, his brother
(who is still alive and braver than Hilli Shah and also a better artilleryman);
as for Uruz Ali, he was put in prison for a fortnight by the order of
the Maharaja, as soon as he came to Gilgit, although Zoraweru wanted
him to share the fate of Sultan. At that time Kalashmir of Dareyl
visited Gilgit and was well entertained by Zoraweru for twenty days, when
he presented him with a shawl and Rs. 100 and gave cheap shawls to the
Sirdars who came with Kalashmir. Zoraweru then asked them, as he had
conquered the whole of Yaghistan, to collect tribute for the Maharaja.
This was agreed to, but when Kalashmir returned to his country he did
nothing. In the war that will ensue I was present all through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<h3>V.—WAR WITH DAREYL [YAGHISTAN] 1866.</h3>

<p>When Zoraweru saw that the Hill, or Yaghistan tribes kept quiet he
thought it a good opportunity for attacking Dareyl, which, he fancied,
would fall easily. He appointed spies to bring to him any Dareylis that
might happen to visit Gilgit. Aziz, a Lamberdár of Manikial, came with
100 goats to Gilgit and when he had sold them, visited Zoraweru, who
received him kindly and entertained him for two days. When he left, the
Kashmir General asked him to remind Kalashmir that he had not sent the
tribute of Dareyl and Tangir, which had been promised two years ago and
gave him an ultimatum of one month in which to come himself or send the
tribute, otherwise Zoraweru would pay Kalashmir a visit with his army.
Kalashmir replied that the Kashmiris had better come and take the taxes
and that there was no occasion for his fellow-countrymen to take the least
notice of the threat. When twenty days of the month had passed, two
other messengers, one a Kashmiri, Kurban, residing at Kiner in Chilás;
the other, Rahm Nur of Samegial—both traders, happening to be at Gilgit,
were sent to announce Zoraweru’s immediate attack and to ask the Hillmen
to prepare themselves, because, as Zoraweru said, “it is my custom
to give my enemy notice three times.” Kalashmir replied he did not care
and next day requested the tribes to assemble at Samegiál—<i>viz</i>: the people
of Tórr, Harbenn, Shatiál, Sazîn, Sômer—and of Tangi, Lurok, Dayamur,
Sheikho, Jalkôt, Galli, Kammi, and Korgah. He even sent to the Kandiá
people for help, who, however, replied that their harvest was just getting
ready and that Dareyl was too far off. He also sent to Jagloth, Chilás,
Hudur, Takk, Buder, and Gor. The Chilásis flatly refused on the ground
of being subjects of Kashmir and being helpless. Jalkôt also did not send,
as the notice had reached them too late and the war was immediately
impending. The rest all assembled at Samegiál on the 10th day and were
7,000 in number; there were also 7,000 men from Dareyl itself. The
Sikhs also started from Gilgit, on hearing which Kalashmir appointed four
scouts at each of the following six posts: in the Kargá valley—at Karóri-Jóji—at
Ruro-Dader, fifteen kos off—at Gitshár, at the same distance—at
Barîga, sixteen kos distance—and at Naranéiga, fifteen kos.</p>

<p>From Samegial the tribes marched over the Dummu-dummu mountain
to the valley of Bariga where they halted. Next morning at about
9 o’clock, after only a few had taken food, the heavens seemed to become
dark. Looking round we saw a Dareyli waving his dress at the Karori-Joji
post, which was a sign of the approach of the enemy. We all got ready
and an hour afterwards the enemy came up, who had taken 11,000 men
from Gilgit. A Sirdar of Samegial, Kuwéti, who had fled about four years
ago to Gilgit from his village in consequence of the enmity of another
fellow-villager, Dodár, now showed the way to the Sikhs. When the forces
reached Yatshotsh below Dummu-dummu on the Gilgit side, he asked
Zoraweru to confide the guidance of the troops to him, as he alone knew
the paths. Zoraweru assenting, Kuweti divided the forces into three
bodies; one under General Har Chand in the direction of the valley of
Dutial, the second under Sirdar Shahzada he despatched to the Yatshotsh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
valley—whilst the third was forwarded with Zoraweru to the Bariga valley—he
himself going with the first column. We did not know these tricks
and thought we had only to deal with the troops advancing on Barîga and
rushed on them at once. The fight lasted till four in the afternoon.
Accidentally, a Dareyli looking in the direction of Jadári-Jùt, saw from
that “grassy plain” such a cloud of dust arise that the sky was darkened
and out of which troops emerged. The Manikialis, whose village is five
kos from that plain, fled at once to defend their homes, as they thought
the enemy threatened Manikial. This was followed by the flight of the
Samegialis by the Dareyl valley—an hour afterwards the people of Phugotsh,
then the people of Gayá, also fled in the same direction. Now the fight
ceased and night broke in. We remained at Bariga. The fugitives on
reaching their villages, fled onwards with their families, some to Sazin,
others to Tangîr, others again to Shatial. Yet we only lost five in killed
and three in wounded—the losses of the Sikhs it is impossible to estimate.
I alone counted twenty from where I stood. The Sikhs during the night
surrounded us and cut off our retreat. At day-break, the fight was renewed
and lasted till noon, when we discovered a mountain path for flight which
we took and came to Samegial. The second day we lost nine men and the
Sikhs thirty. The Sikhs remained for ten days at Jadári-Jùt and then
advanced on Samegial <i>via</i> the District of Manikial, of which they burnt two
villages, Shinó Kot and Yashkunó Kot, and killed the old women and
children who had not been able to get away; four boys were found ill and
also killed. Reaching Samegial, they found that we had fled on to Gayá.
In that District the Sikhs also burnt two deserted villages, Dudó Kot and
Birió Kot; they found, however, twelve fugitive women and children
<i>en route</i> and killed them. The Sikhs stayed at Samegial, where 200 of us
had remained concealed at about a mile from the place. A fight took
place with a loss of four on our side and twelve on the part of the Sikhs.
We were not followed up to Gayá. The Sikhs returned to Manikial where
they remained ten days and indulged in eating the grapes which had
become over-ripe and are very abundant in that District. Many died from
disease engendered by this over-indulgence, but the Sikh Sirdars spread a
report that the tribes had scattered poison on the grapes. Winter also set
in, and snow fell, so the Sikhs returned to Gilgit. <i>En route</i> snow-storms
set in, which blinded some and froze others. The Sikhs lost in dead about
120 men. The fugitive villagers now returned to their homes and rebuilt
the burnt down villages. Six months later, Kalashmîr of Dudokôt (Samegiál)
and Duran of Phugôtsh and Surió of Karînokot (Mánikial) and Burshù
Sirdar of Biliokôt, (Manikial) and Sirdar of Gayá and Nur Muhammed of
Shurôt started for Gilgit and offered allegiance to Zoraweru. He replied;
“Oh! Kalashmir, thou hast given me much trouble and inflicted much
injury. Now I want a goat per annum from every two houses throughout
Dareyl.” He then dismissed them with Khilats and now the tribute is
regularly paid from those villages that I have named as being represented
on that occasion by their Sirdars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>It is necessary to say a few words about the treatment of those
who had assisted Kashmir. After Doulat Shù had arranged
matters with Chitrál, Zoraweru appointed him over the yield of
the gold washing of Bakrôt, Sakwár, Jutial, Deyúr, Minôr, Nomal, and
Gilgit. The mode of taxation on gold washings is as follows: the men
work two months in spring and two months in autumn and have to pay
Rs. 3, or 2 gold Rupees = about 5 Chilki Rupees, for each season per
head. Taxes are also raised on the produce, viz., a third of the whole.
Doulat Shù received 10 Chilkis per mensem for that service. He went
one autumn for the first time and brought back the taxes collected, which
were sent to the Maharajah through Baghdur Shah. Six weeks later, some
gold washers came to Gilgit to pay their respects to Zoraweru, who asked
them whether they had had a bad season as the taxes paid had been small.
The goldwashers said that it had been as good as usual: so Zoraweru, on
referring to the accounts of the preceding year, found a difference of 5 tolas
(about 60 Rupees). Doulat Shu was at once thrown into chains and sent
to Jammu in charge of Ghulam Haidar and Mirza. The Maharajah sent
him to the same place in which Sultan is confined and where both are now.
In neither case was there an investigation. When Isa Bahadur heard of
the imprisonment of men who had rendered such services as Sultan and
Doulat Shu he came to Gilgit, where he found Ghulam Haidar and Mirza
and took them to Jammu. They there interceded for the prisoners with
the Maharajah and represented that brave and faithful men should not be
punished with perpetual imprisonment, one of whom had conquered a
country for His Highness, which the other had kept for Kashmir by his
admirable arrangement with Chitrál. The Maharajah told them to go
about their own business. When they heard this, they left, but, in their
correspondence during four years, they constantly urged the release of the
prisoners on His Highness. Two years ago they again presented themselves
at Jammu and represented that the years that Sultan and Doulat
Shu had already passed in prison were a sufficient punishment. They
conjured His Highness by his idol, but the Maharajah threatened to send
them to keep company with the prisoners if they did not at once desist
from their importunities.</p>

<p>When Isa Bahadur heard such words, he left the same night and galloped
on without stopping, till he had got to Sher Kila. He still considers that
he has been very discourteously treated by Kashmir and his correspondence
with the Maharajah has ceased. I have heard him lament over the past.
Ghulam Haidar and Mirza kept on for a whole month importuning His
Highness, who resolved on imprisoning them, when they fortunately asked
and obtained leave to go home to Gilgit. The three Chiefs have not
visited Jammu since the affair which I have related.</p>

<h2 id="PRESENT_STATE_OF_MIR_VALI">PRESENT STATE OF MIR VALI.</h2>

<p>A year and a half ago Mir Vali (who drugs himself with charas = a preparation
of hemp) got offended with Pahlivan, (probably on account of a
difference of opinion in <i>re</i> Hayward);<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> went to Kandiá (road described
elsewhere) and to Manikiál [not the village so often referred to in the
account of the Wars] on the borders of Swat. Thence he went to Tall,
Ramta, Berahmar and then to Beïkéy, the Akhûn of Swat, who asked him
why he had come. Mir Vali said that Pahlivan had annoyed him and as
the Akhun was a great Saint he had come to him, having no other friends.
The Akhun entertained him for eight months, after which, on a Friday
(when service takes place at noon instead of 2 <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span>) he told him to go
back to Yasin, “for your heart’s desire has been accomplished.” Mir Vali
at once started off on horseback, taking the bank of the Indus. On the
third day he reached Ghorband; thence he went to Damtirey, Bilkái,
Ranulia and Jajiál; there he crossed the river to Kúi; thence to Palus,
Gagréy Khware (or in Gilgiti, Gabréga), Shogobind (a place for pasture)
Jaglôth, Tekkegá, Parbáh (a place for pasture) Latór, Sazin, Dareyl, <i>viz</i>:
Gayá, Samegial (where he stayed a week in order to consult Mulk Aman,
who was there) Manekial, the Matrêt valley (pasture place for Gujers), and
finally to Yasin. There he was well received by Pahlivan who could not
understand why he had left and now the brothers love each other more
than before. The rule is in the hands of Mir Vali who keeps up friendly
relations with the Dogras and would strengthen these relations still further
were it not for fear of Aman-ul-mulk, who is a great enemy of the Maharajah
and who has ordered him to have as little to do with them or Isa
Bahadur as possible. [<a href="#Footnote_103"><i>Vide</i> note on next page.</a>]</p>

<h3>MULK AMAN.</h3>

<p>When Mulk Aman remembered his country, Yasin, he fell home-sick in
Chitrál and begged Aman-ul-mulk to let him go and, if Aman-ul-mulk
would assist him, he would fight the Sikhs or else die as a martyr. Aman-ul-mulk
said that Mulk Aman could only do the latter, as he had no army
left. “I advise you, he added, to go to Dareyl and ask the Maharajah’s
forgiveness, who may give you some appointment. Serve him, he said, as
Isa Bahadur has done and you may be restored to the throne of your
ancestors.” Aman-ul-mulk said this in order to get rid of the importunities
of Mulk-Aman, who left for Samegial. Baghdur Shah and Kuweti, the
Maharajah’s agents, happened to be there and actually offered to intercede
with the Maharajah on his behalf and to get him an appointment. Mulk
Aman was delighted. The agents spoke in his favour to the Maharajah
who cheerfully ordered him to present himself. They came to Samegial
and brought Mulk Aman to Jammu. His Highness bestowed a dress of
honour, a horse and Rs. 200 on him and a monthly salary of Rs. 100 for
himself, Rs. 30 for his son and Rs. 50 for the rest of his family and
requested him to live at Gilgit outside the fort. “Remain there for 7
years; afterwards I will give you Yasin.” This Mulk Aman did and built
a house about 100 yards from the fort. He did not, however, for two years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
send for his family from Samegial where he had left them when he started
for Jammu. When they came he continued serving Kashmir for four years
more. Isa Bahadur, however, happened to tell Zoraweru last year (for Isa
was the arch-enemy of Mulk Aman and feared his getting back to Yasin)
that Mulk Aman intended to escape with his family to Chitrál, after which,
as he had plotted with the Gilgitis, there would be a general revolt which
would end in his sharing the Government of Yasin with Pahlivan. When
Zoraweru heard this he consulted with Isa Bahadur, who advised him to
seize Mulk Aman and send him and his family to Jammu at once, so as
not to give him time to rouse the country. This pleased the Governor
and a suitable hour was left to Isa’s discretion for surrounding the house
and bringing Mulk Aman and his family before Zoraweru. Isa Bahadur
at once went and selected 400 young men whom he ordered to be in
readiness at four in the afternoon. Accidentally a friend of Mulk Aman
overheard the conversation between Zoraweru and Isa Bahadur and at
once informed him of what was contemplated and of the arrangements
made by Isa. The friend advised him to flee at once into the mountains.
Mulk Aman, greatly astonished, went to his house and ordered his family
to get ready to start. Just as his women were coming out of the house, he
saw Isa Bahadur with his soldiers all round it. Mulk Aman drew his
sword, ran a-muck among the troops and after killing a few soldiers managed
to escape alone into the mountains in the direction of Dareyl.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> However
swiftly pursued he could not be found; the Sikhs returned from the mountain
and took the family prisoners. Mulk Aman, descending on the other
side of the mountain, came to Samegial. Isa Bahadur then presented the
women and children as hostages to Zoraweru who forwarded them to
Jammu, where they still remain. Shortly afterwards the Maharajah heard
that Mulk Aman was perfectly innocent of any conspiracy and had been
got out of the way by the calumny of Isa Bahadur, the enemy of the house
of Gauhar Aman from which he had suffered. The Maharajah was very
sorry at what had taken place and ordered Muhammad Khan of Swat to
bring the brave and unfortunate man back from Samegial under liberal
promises of rewards and appointments. The Swati started and told Mulk
Aman that he was responsible that no treachery was intended. All was
in vain; he insulted Muhammad Khan and raved about the loss of honour,
etc., which he had suffered at the hands of the Maharajah. “If he makes
me his greatest Sirdar he can not wipe out the stain of having taken away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
my wife.” Muhammad Khan returned to Jammu from his fruitless expedition
and told the Maharajah, who was very sorry. Twenty eight days
after Muhammad Khan’s visit, Mulk Aman, considering himself unsafe,
went to Harbenn, which is still Yaghistan [independent, wild]. Zoraweru
then advised the Maharajah to send for him, as he had got among the
Yaghis and might incite them to an attack on Gilgit. “Above all, make
him satisfied.” When the Maharajah read Zoraweru’s letter, he again sent
the Swati to Harbenn and told him to swear on the Koran, on his own
behalf and that of His Highness, that it was all Isa’s fault and that he
would give Mulk Amán his revenge for the wrong suffered and allow him
double his former salary. This Muhammad Khan did and saw Mulk
Aman at Harbenn to whom he brought a shawl as a present from himself.
He told him, in private, after “salâming” to him at a public meeting, all
that he was charged to say and took an oath in attestation of the sincerity
of his promises. Mulk Aman replied that he would not fall a victim to
treachery and that if he said another word or came again he would certainly
kill him. So Muhammad Khan left and again had to report his
failure. “Only an army can bring him, he said, back from Harbenn.”
The Maharajah is hoping now that he will get tired of wandering about
and come back of his own accord. During the last eight months he has
sent nobody for him. Mulk Aman is very badly off and is now at Rimon
(Dareyl) and I am quite sure that the Yaghistanis will never assist him.
His brothers will not help him. His wife (Mahtar’s widow) is now at
Jammu and reports have spread about her conduct.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In connexion with the Sazîni’s account, which in all particulars relating
to the tribes is very trustworthy, may be read the following statements of
S... S... of Kûner, on the borders of Kafiristan, now a Christian. He
relates that he was once a Sepoy in the Maharajah’s Army and started on
one of the Gilgit expeditions [1860?] with 300 Affghans and 3,000 Dogras,
etc., under the command of Samund Khan, Ata Muhammad, Badam
Singh, Man Singh and Dula Singh. He believes that Wazir Pannu was
with the forces. At any rate, the attack on Gilgit was mere child’s play.
The Kashmîr troops bombarded it for two or three days, but the Dards
had no cannon with which to reply. Wahháb, the Wazir, looked out of
one of the fort loopholes and was shot and so was a Bhishti. Wahháb’s
body was stripped and hung to a tree. S... S... adds, “We were well
entertained by the people who treated us to curds and we found grapes
and wallnuts in abundance at Sher Kila’. The women of the country
cooked our food, but our soldiers repayed the hospitality which they
received by plundering and ill-treating the inhabitants. I remained behind,
but when my company came back they told me that the Sikhs wanted to
dig out the body of Gauhar Aman, but were prevented from doing so by
their own Muhammadan comrades. We found caverns in the mountains
which were filled with food for the use of the enemy. It is the custom of
this people to heap up food in caverns to which the owners only know the
way. After entrusting Sher Kila’ (a fort as big as that of Gilgit and constructed
of wooden beams and stone) to the administration of native
partisans, we went to Gao-Kutsh, where we found plenty of sport. Gauhar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Aman used to sell captured Sepoys for hunting dogs.” (This story is
repeated from so many trustworthy quarters that it seems to deserve
credence. I heard it from many at Gilgit in 1866. The kidnapping propensities
of Gauhar Aman were great and one of my own retainers, a petty
Chief, had been dragged off for sale, when he escaped by sliding down a
mountain side. Yet the people of Gilgit preferred his rule to that of
Kashmir and revolted in his favour, when oppressed by Santu Singh in
1852). “We had two Hindustani rebels of 1857 with us and there were
also several with the petty Rajahs.” [This important statement can be
somewhat confirmed by me. What I understood to be the fourth Light
Kashmir Cavalry was said to be almost entirely composed of rebels of
1857. I found many of the stations in charge of Swatis and numbers of
soldiers of that race at Gilgit. One of the Maharajah’s Sepoys, who came
to see me, admitted that he was formerly at Hyderabad and then had
joined the rebels.]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I can also confirm the statements of the Sazîni with regard to the
atrocities committed in the War with Dareyl. In order to be able to report
victories, men, said to be innocent of complicity in the war, were hanged
and women were dragged into captivity in order to fill the Zananas of the
Kashmîr Sepoys. I saw the body of a tall, and powerfully built Dareyli,
which had evidently been hacked about a good deal, suspended on a tree
by the way-side. It was said to be the body of a man who was quietly
returning to Sai, which had long been in the undisturbed occupation of the
Maharajah. A little further on near Jaglôth [which is also in long-occupied
territory] there is a bridge on one of the poles of which I saw the skeleton
head of a Lumberdar of the place, said to be perfectly innocent of all participation
in the war with Kashmir. The roofs of the houses in Gilgit had
been blown off, and most of the inhabitants had fled into the mountains
(<a href="#Page_36"><i>vide</i> “dance at Gilgit” page 36</a>). On the other hand, dreadful stories
were related of the retaliation of the Dard tribes. Sepoys had been sold
by hundreds into Badakhshan, etc.; others had been used as fireworks
and blown to atoms for the amusement of the Kunjûtis. Personally, I
found the Dards pleasant enough and consider them to be superior in
many respects to either Dogras or Pathans, but it is by no means improbable
that they have been guilty of many of the atrocities which are laid to
their charge. At the same time, it must be remembered that the wanton
cruelties of the Massacre of Yasin (<a href="#Page_69"><i>vide</i> page 69</a>) and the fact that their
country was invaded by a stranger and an “infidel”—in defiance of treaty
obligations—is some palliation for their conduct. The Kashmîr troops,
and more particularly the coolies sent with them, were also grossly
neglected as regards food, clothing and shelter by their own authorities.
It is said that out of 12,000 Kashmiris, impressed for the purpose of
carrying loads, only 600 survived in the expedition of 1866. The roads
were strewn with the skeletons of horses, etc. I saw men in the most
emaciated condition and ready to eat “unlawful” food. Three Mussulmans
in a dying condition whom I met below the “Acho” summit,<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
ready to take a tin containing pork and could scarcely be restrained till
“lawful” food was brought to them by my servants. Men were forced to
go with the troops. One Hakím Ali Shah, a teacher at Amritsar, was
compelled to serve as a physician, a post to which he had no other claim,
except that his name happened to be “Hakím.” I rescued him. A
virulent fever was destroying the troops at Gilgit, who, even after the siege
of the fort had been raised, were liable to be shot down by prowlers from
the tribes within a few yards of the fort. I ordered the fort, etc., to be
cleaned and, although myself in danger of life from my Kashmîr friends,
if not from the tribes, I insisted on my order being obeyed, the assumption
of an authoritative tone being often a traveller’s only chance of safety
among Asiatics. I distributed medicine among the troops and was afterwards
told in Durbar by the Maharajah that some medicine which I had
sent to Wazir Zoraweru, who was then on his Dureyl expedition, had saved
his life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since then, the Dards have made the acquaintance of diseases for which
there was not even a name in 1866. I refer chiefly to cholera and syphilis,
which Kashmiri and Indian troops have introduced. Simultaneously, the
indigenous methods of treatment, which are full of lessons for the impartial
learner, are dying out. Industrial handicrafts, historical superstitions or
reminiscences, national feasts which existed in 1866 exist no longer, and
what exists now will soon vanish before the monotony of orthodox
Muhammadanism and the vulgarity of so-called European civilization.
“<i>Und der Götter bunt Gewimmel, Hat sogleich das stille Haus geleert.</i>”
The fairies and prophetesses of Dardistan are silent, the Tham of Hunza
no longer brings down rain, the family axes are broken, the genealogists
have been destroyed, and the sacred drum is heard no longer. The quaint
computations of age, of months, seasons, years and half-years, and the
strange observations of shadows thrown at various times are dying out or
are already dead. Worse than all for enquiry into ancient human history,
the languages which contain the words of “<i>what once was</i>,” are being flooded
by foreign dialects, and what may survive will no longer appeal to the national
understanding. This result is most lamentable as regards Hunza, where the
oldest human speech still showed elementary processes of development. I
fear that my attempt to commit, for the first time, to writing, in an adapted
<i>Persian</i> character, the Khajuná language, has only been followed in a document
of honour which the venerable Chief of Nagyr sent me some years ago.
Already do some European writers call him and his people “ignorant” when
their own ignorance is alone deserving of censure. I deeply regret that the
friendship of so many Dard Chiefs for me has made them unsuspicious of
Europeans, and may have thus indirectly led to the loss of their independence,
but I rejoice that for over twenty-five years I have not attracted the European
adventurer to Dardistan by saying anything about Pliny’s “<i>fertilissimi
sunt auri Dardæ</i>,” except in Khajuná Ethnographical Dialogues in the
“Hunza-Nagyr Handbook,” which exploiters were not likely to read. Now
others have published the fact, but not the accompanying risks.</p>

<p>As Kandiá is learned, Nagyr pious, Chilás puritanical, and all true
Dard tribes essentially peaceful and virtuously republican, so, no doubt,
Hunza was the country of free love and of raiding, that had ceased in 1865,
which <i>we</i> practically revived (<a href="#APPENDIX_I">see Appendix I.</a>). I doubt, however, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
picturesque vice, which, unfortunately, may form part of indigenous associations,
is as reprehensible as the hypocrisy of those hired knights of the
pen, who, not practising the virtues which they preach, take away the
character of nations and of Chiefs, merely because they are opposed to us, and
falsify their history. I do not, for instance, palliate the old Hunza practice
of lending one’s wife to a guest, or of kidnapping good-looking
strangers in order to improve the race, though the latter course may be
preferred by a physiologist to a careless marriage, but I do find a
reproach on European or Indian morality in the fact that not a single
Hunza woman showed herself to the British or Kashmîri invaders, although
the men, once conquered, freely joined them in sport and drinking bouts.
Europeans have a worse reputation among Orientals than Orientals among
Europeans, and, in either case, ignorance, prejudice, want of sympathy and
disinclination to learn the truth, are probably among the causes of such
regrettable preconceptions. At any rate, it shall not be said that the races
which I, so disastrously for them, discovered and named, shall suffer from
any misrepresentation so far as I can help it, although the political passions
of the moment may deprive my statements of the weight which
has hitherto attached to them as authoritative in this speciality. <i>Væ
victis et victoribus</i>—for history now marches rapidly towards the common
disaster. <i>Finis Dardarum.</i> “It has been decided that <span class="smcap">Chilás</span> is to be
<i>permanently</i> held, and consequently the present strength of the garrison in
the <span class="smcap">Gilgit</span> district will be <i>increased</i> by one native regiment, while the 23rd
Pioneers will complete the road through the Kaghan Valley to Chilás, and
will then <i>remain for duty on the advanced frontier</i>. This strengthening of
the garrison in the sub-Himalayan country will effectually <i>secure British
influence</i> over <span class="smcap">Chitral</span> where an Agent is to be <i>permanently</i> stationed; it
will also insure the <i>control of the Indus Valley tribes</i>” (<i>Times</i> telegram of
the 8th July, 1893—the italics are mine). Alas that British influence
should so destroy both itself and the freedom of ancient races!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Quem Deus vult perdere prius dementat.</i> Considering the promises of
redress of all grievances made by the Great Northern Emancipator of
Oppressed Nationalities,<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> whose lightest finger is heavier than our entire yoke,
it would be a great mistake on our part to still further reduce the independence
of Native States, the troops of which are already at our disposal. Even as
regards Kashmir, against the mismanagement of which I have protested for
so many years, and the Agents of which made several attempts on my life
in order to prevent my exposure of their frontier encroachments in 1866, I
am bound to say that our procedure has been a great deal too peremptory,
if not altogether illegal. The following Treaty between Kashmir and the
British Government shows alike that Kashmir had no right to encroach on
Chilás and Gilgit (see preceding pages), and still less on Hunza-Nagyr,
and that the Government of India has no right to convert Kashmir into a
“<i>semi</i>-independent State” as called by the <i>Times</i> of the 8th July, 1893.
Kashmir is an <i>independent</i> State, whose independence has been paid for
and must be protected by our honour against our ambition, as long as it is
loyal to the British Government:</p>

<p><i>Note on the Genealogy of the divine Rajas of Nagyr</i> (given to me by Raja Habibulia
Khan of Nagyr in 1886).—At Doyur, near Gilgit, on the mountain-top, three fairy-brothers
shot at a calf, which only the youngest (Azru) hit and was induced to eat, thereby losing
his fairy-hood. The two others flew away and settled on another mountain, but the crowing
of a cock betrayed them to the people of Gilgit who made one of them, Tura Khan,
Raja of Gilgit; the other, Chalis Khan, becoming Raja of Nagyr. [This account is incorrect
as <i>Azru</i> became Raja of Gilgit, because he had become man by eating meat
(<i>incarnation</i>), but it is interesting as showing the desire of Nagyris to be connected with
the Historical Legend of the origin of the neighbouring and more civilized Gilgit. Some
say that Chalis Khan had no son, but that the Rajas of Nagyr are the descendants of
the Makpon rulers of Little Tibet (from which the Makpon-i-Shang-rong—<a href="#Page_107">see page 107</a>—takes
its name). Others say that Alladad was a son of Chalis Khan: at all events, the
founders of the Hunza-Nagyr Dynasty, Girkis-Mogholot, two brothers, whether descended
from Mogholot or Chalis, are called Mogholoti, Girkis becoming the Tham of Hunza, and
Mogholot that of Nagyr. As for Alladad, he was succeeded by Kamal, whom Rahim and
Babar (or tiger) followed in turn. Babar’s son was Ferdûs, and his son Alif Khan was
the father of the present reigning Chief, Zafar Khan, whose progeny is very numerous].
[The above account, although very deficient and confused, supplements, as regards
Hunza-Nagyr, the important “historical legend of the origin of Gilgit,” which will be
found on <a href="#D_Legend">pages 9 to 16</a>, and which chronicles the change in the Shîn rule in Dardistan.
The mystery in the Hunza-Nagyr dynasty fitly entitles it to be called “ayeshó,” or
“heavenly.” I can quite understand that the Chief of Hunza, unable to convince European
disbelievers of his divine origin, should have claimed a descent from Alexander the Great,
<i>faute de mieux</i>, since the more terrestrial chiefs of Badakhshan and other neighbouring
countries claim to be descended from that conqueror.] (See note on <a href="#Footnote_61">page 55</a> and <a href="#Footnote_82">page 69</a>.)</p>

<p>Colonel Biddulph gives the following interesting version of the above story:</p>

<p>“The ruling family of Hunza is called Ayeshé (heavenly), from the following circumstance.
The two States of Hunza and Nager were formerly one, ruled by a branch of
the Shahreis, the ruling family of Gilgit, whose seat of government was Nager. Tradition
relates that Mayroo Khan, apparently the first Mahommedan Thum of Nager, some
two hundred years after the introduction of the religion of Islam in to Gilgit, married a
daughter of Trakhan of Gilgit, who bore him twin sons, named Moghlot and Girkis.
From the former the present ruling family of Nager is descended. The twins are said to
have shown hostility to one another from their birth. Their father, seeing this, and
unable to settle the question of succession, divided his State between them, giving to
Girkis the north, and to Moghlot the south, bank of the river.</p>

<p>Age did not diminish their enmity, and Girkis, while out hunting, was one day killed
by an adherent of Moghlot, a native of Haramosh, named Mogul Beg, who, under pretence
of a quarrel with Moghlot, took service with Girkis, and persuading him to look
up at some game on the cliff above him, drove an arrow into his throat. Girkis left only
a daughter, who, according to the custom of the country, became Queen or Ganish of
Hunza. Her first care was to avenge her father’s death. The tradition relates that
having sworn to tear the murderer’s liver with her teeth, she carried out her vow to the
letter. Left without a chaperon, she was not long without getting into a scrape, as
young ladies in similar circumstances are apt to do. The young prince Kamal Khan of
Nager, a younger son of Moghlot, crossed the river by night, serenaded her and won her
heart. Night after night the lovers met, unknown to the rest of the world, till serious
consequences ensued; and one fine day it was announced in Hunza that, though Providence
had not yet provided the princess with a husband, it had seen fit to bless her with
a son. Morals in Hunza are not of the strictest even now, so that few questions were
asked, and the good people generally contented themselves with beating their drums,
dancing, and the usual festivities proper on the occasion of the birth of the Prince Chiliss
Khan. Kamal Khan seems to have ‘behaved badly’ all through, as the above story
is concealed in Hunza under the fiction that a prince of Shighnan became the husband
of the princess, but that his name being forgotten he is known only as Ayeshó (Heaven-sent),
from which the present ruling family of Hunza takes the name. The present
Thum of Hunza is Ghazan Khan” (1880).</p>

<p>I wish to record how from small beginnings, owing to
carelessness, exclusiveness, and official desire for promotion,
Northern India may be lost and British interests in Europe
and Asia become subordinate, as they have often been,
to Russian guidance; how statesmanship has laboriously
invited dangers which physical barriers had almost rendered
impossible; and how it may still be practicable to maintain
as independent States the numerous mountain strongholds
which Nature has interposed between encroachment and
intrigue from either the Russian or the English sphere of
action in Asia, much to the benefit of these two Powers
and of the peace of mankind.</p>

<p>When, after an enormous expenditure of men and money
and during campaigns which lasted over thirty-six years,
Russia had conquered independent Circassia—a task in
which she was largely aided by our preventing provisions
and ammunitions from reaching by sea the so-called rebels,
although we ourselves were fighting against her in 1856,
<i>quorum pars parva fui</i>, it was easy to foresee that our conduct,
which some called chivalry, others loyalty, and some
duplicity or folly, would give her the present command of
the Black Sea and lead to the subjugation of Circassia. The
same conduct was repeated at Panjdeh, and may be repeated
on the Pamir, much to the personal advantage of the discreet
officers concerned. We have also recently discovered that
the holding of Constantinople by a neutral Power is not
essential to British interests, as we had long ago found out
that neither Merv nor Herat were keys to India. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_2" id="Appendix_1_Page_2">[2]</a></span>
as we give up position after position, a crop of honours falls
to those who bring about our losses and, like charity, covers
a multitude of political sins of ignorance or treason.</p>

<p>It seemed, however, that there was one obscure corner
which the official sidelight could not irradiate. Valley
after valley, plateau after plateau, high mountains and
difficult passes separate the populations of India from those
of Central Asia. Innumerable languages and warlike races,
each unconquerable in their own strongholds if their
autonomy and traditions are respected, intervene between
invaders from either side who would lead masses of disciplined
slaves to slaughter and conquest. It is not necessary
to draw an imaginary line on Lord Salisbury’s large or
small Map of Asia across mountains and rivers, and dividing
arbitrarily tribes and kingdoms whose ancestry is the
same, call it “the neutral zone.” No sign-board need
indicate “the way to India,” and amid much ado about
nothing by ambitious subordinates and puzzled superiors
settle to the momentary satisfaction of the British public
that Russia can go so far and no farther. Where the
cold, the endless marching over inhospitable ground, and
starvation do not show the frontier, the sparse population,
the unknown tongue, and the bullet of the raider will
indicate it sufficiently, without adding to the number of
generals or knights for demarcating impossible boundaries.</p>

<p>The reassurances given by Lords Lansdowne and Cross
to the native Princes of India indicate the policy that
should be adopted with regard to all the Mountain States
beyond India proper. It is by everywhere respecting the
existing indigenous Oriental Governments that we protect
them and ourselves against invasion from without and
treachery from within. The loyalty of our feudatories is
most chivalrous and touching, but it should be based on
enlightened self-interest in order to withstand the utmost
strain. The restoration of some powers to the Maharaja
of Kashmîr came not a minute too soon. Wherever elsewhere
reasonable claims are withheld, they should be generously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_3" id="Appendix_1_Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and speedily conceded. The Indian princes know
full well that we are arming them, at their own expense,
against a common foe who is not wanting in promises,
and who is already posing as a saviour to the people of
Raushan, Shignan, Wakhan, Hunza, and even Badakhshan,
whose native dynasties or traditions we have either
already put aside or are believed to threaten.</p>

<p>As for the small States offering a fruitful field for intrigue,
their number and internal jealousies (except against a common
foreign invader) are in themselves a greater safeguard
than the resistance of a big but straggling ally, whose
frontier, when broken through at one of its many weak
points, finds an unresisting population from which all
initiative has disappeared. The intrigue or treachery of
a big ally is also a more serious matter than that of a
little State. What does it matter if English and Russian
agents intrigue or fraternize among the <i>ovis poli</i>, and
the Kirghiz shepherds of the Pamir, or advocate their
respective civilizations in Yasin, Chitrál, Wakhan, Nagyr,
Hunza, etc. Ambitious employes of both empires will
always trouble waters, in order to fish in them; but their
trouble is comparatively innocuous, and resembles that of
Sisyphus when it has to be repeated or wasted in a dozen
States, before the real defences of either India or of Russia
in Asia are reached. Indeed, so far as India is concerned,
the physical difficulties on our side of the Himalayas or of
the Hindukush, except at a few easily defensible passes, are
insuperable to an invader, even after he has crowned the
more approachable heights when coming from the North.</p>

<p>The only policy worthy of the name is to leave the
Pamir alone. Whatever line is drawn, it is sure to be
encroached upon by either side. Races will be found to
overlap it, and in the attempt to gather the fold, as with
the Sarik and Salor Turkomans, a second Panjdeh is sure
to follow. Intrigues will be active on both sides of the
line; and, as in Kashmîr, the worried people will hail the
foreigner as a saviour, so long as he has not taken possession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_4" id="Appendix_1_Page_4">[4]</a></span>
when they find his little finger heavier than the whole
body of the indigenous oppressor. I have suffered so much
from my persistent exposure of the misrule and intrigues of
Kashmîr by those who now hail the <i>fait accompli</i> of its
practical annexation, that I may claim to be heard in favour
of at least one feature of its former native administration.
With bodies of troops averaging from 20 to 200, the late
Maharaja, who foresaw what has happened after his death,
kept the Hunza-Nagyr frontier in order. It certainly was
by rule of thumb, and had no dockets, red tape, and reports.
Indeed, his frontier guardians were, as I found them, asleep
during a state of siege in 1866, or, when war was over,
were engaged in storing grain <i>outside</i> the forts; but peace was
kept as it will never be again, in spite of 2,000 Imperial
troops, first-rate roads, and suspension bridges over the
“Shaitan Naré,” instead of the rotten rope-way that spanned
“Satan’s Gorge,” or of boats dragged up from Srinagar
over the mountains to enable a dozen sepoys to cross the
Indus at a time, or to convey couriers with a couple of
bullets, some dried butter-cakes, and an open letter or two,
who ran the siege at Gilgit and brought such effective
reinforcements to its defenders!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;" id="illus10">

</div>

<p>Nor has our diplomacy been more effectual than our
arms, as the encounter at Chalt with Hunza-Nagyr,
hereditary foes, but whom our policy has united against us,
has shown. To us Nagyr is decidedly friendly; but a worm
will turn if trodden on by some of our too quickly advanced
subalterns. That, however, the wise and amiable
Chief of Nagyr, a patriarch with a large progeny, and preserving
the keenness of youth in his old age, is really
friendly to us in spite of provocation, may be inferred from
the following letter to me, which does credit alike to his
head and heart, and which is far from showing him to be
our inveterate foe, as alleged by the <i>Pioneer</i>. His eldest
son began to teach me the remarkable Khajuná language,
which I first committed to writing in 1866, during the siege
of Gilgit, and another son continued the lessons in 1886.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_5" id="Appendix_1_Page_5">[5]</a></span>
The latter is a hostage in Kashmîr, to secure the good
behaviour of his tribe, which is really infinitely superior in
culture and piety to those around them. The father, who
is over 90, writes in Persian to the following effect, after the
usual compliments:—“The affairs of this place are by your
fortune in a fair way, and I am in good health and constantly
ask the same for you from the Throne which grants
requests. Your kind favour with a drawing of the Mosque
has reached me, and has given me much pleasure and
satisfaction. The reason of the delay in its receipt and
acknowledgment is due to the circumstance that, owing to
disturbances (<i>fesád</i>) I have not sent agents to Kashmîr this
year. After the restoration of peace, I will send [a letter]
with them. In the meanwhile, I have caught your hem
[seek your protection] for my son Habibullah Khan, a
beloved son, about whom I am anxious; the aforesaid son
is a well-wisher to the illustrious English Government.—<span class="smcap">Za’far
Khan</span>.” [The letter was apparently written in
June last, when <i>The Times</i> reported a “rising,” because
the British Agent was at Chalt with 500 men.]</p>

<p>It seems to me that none but a farseeing man could, in
the midst of a misunderstanding, if not a fight, with us, so
write to one in the enemy’s camp, unless he were a true
man alike in war and peace, and a ruler whose good-will
was worth acquiring. As for his son, I know him to be
indeed well-disposed to our Government. He was very
popular among our officers when I saw him in Kashmîr,
owing to his modesty, amiability, and unsurpassed excellence
at Polo. In fact, my friendship with several of the
chiefs since 1866 has aided our good relations with them;
and it is a pity if they should be destroyed for want of a
little “<i>savoir</i>,” as also “<i>savoir faire</i>,” on our part.</p>

<p>Between the States of Nagyr and Hunza there exists a
perpetual feud. They are literally rivals, being separated
by a swift-flowing river on which, at almost regulated
distances, one Nagyr fort on one bank frowns at the
Hunza fort on the other. The paths along the river sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_6" id="Appendix_1_Page_6">[6]</a></span>
are very steep, involving at times springing from one ledge
of a rock to another, or dropping on to it from a height of
six feet, when, if the footing is lost, the wild torrent sweeps
one away. Colonel Biddulph does not credit the Nagyris
with bravery. History, however, does not bear out his
statement; and the defeat inflicted on the Kashmîr troops
under Nathu Shah in 1848 is a lesson even for the arrogance
of a civilized invader armed with the latest rifle.
The Nagyris are certainly not without culture; in music
they were proficient before the Muhammadan piety of the
Shiah sect somewhat tabooed the art. At all events, they
are different in character from the Hunzas with whom they
share the same language, and their chiefs the same ancestry.
The Hunzas, in whom a remnant of the Huns may be
found, were great kidnappers; but under Kashmîr influence
they stopped raiding since 1869, till the confusion incidental
to our interference revived their gone occupation.
Indeed, it is asserted on good authority, that even our ally
of Chitrál, who had somewhat abandoned the practice of
selling his Shiah or Kalásha Kafir subjects into slavery,
and who had so disposed of the miners for not working his
ruby mines to profit, has now returned to the trade in men,
“with the aid of our present of rifles and our moral support.”
Nor is Bokhara said to be behind Chitrál in the revival of
the slave-trade from Darwáz, in spite of Russian influence;
so that we have the remarkable instance of two great
Powers both opposed to slavery and the slave-trade, having
revived it in their approach to one another. Nor is a
third Power, quite blameless in the matter; for when we
worried Hunza, that robber-nest remembered its old allegiance
to distant Kitái and arranged with the Chinese
authorities at Yarkand to be informed of the departure of
a caravan. Then, after intercepting it on the Kulanuldi
road, the Hunzas would take those they kidnapped from it
back for sale to Yarkand!</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, we have now a scramble for the
regions surrounding and extending into the Pamirs by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_7" id="Appendix_1_Page_7">[7]</a></span>
three Powers, acting either directly or through States of
Straw. The claims of Bokhara to Karategin and Darwáz—if
not to Shignán, Raushan, and Wakhan are as
little founded as are those of Afghanistan on the latter three
districts. Indeed, even the Afghan right to Badakhshan
is very weak. The Russian claims through Khokand on
the pasturages of the Kirghiz in two-thirds of the Pamirs
are also as fanciful as those of Kashmir or China on
Hunza. As in the scramble for Africa, the natives themselves
are not consulted, and their indigenous dynasties
have been either destroyed, or dispossessed, or ignored.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In an Indian paper, received by to-day’s mail (29 Nov.,
1891), I find the following paragraph: “Col. A. G. Durand,
British Agent at Gilgit, has received definite orders to bring
the robber tribes of Hunza and Nagar under control. These
tribes are the pirates of Central Asia, whose chief occupation
is plundering caravans on the Yarkand and Kashgar.
Any prisoners they take on these expeditions are sold into
slavery. Colonel Durand has established an outpost at
Chalt, about thirty miles beyond Gilgit, on the Hunza
river, and intends making a road to Aliabad, the capital
of the Hunza chief, at once. That he will meet with armed
opposition in doing so is not improbable.”</p>

<p>For some months past the <i>mot d’ordre</i> appears to have
been given to the Anglo-Indian Press, to excite public
feeling against Hunza and Nagyr, two States which have
been independent for fourteen centuries. The cause of
offence is not stated, nor, as far as I know, does one exist
of sufficient validity to justify invasion. In the <i>Pioneer</i>
and the <i>Civil and Military Gazette</i> I find vague allusions
to the disloyalty or recalcitrance of the above-mentioned
tribes, and to the necessity of punishing them. As Nagyr
is extremely well-disposed towards the British, and is
only driven into making common cause with its hereditary
foe and rival of Hunza by fear of a common danger,—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_8" id="Appendix_1_Page_8">[8]</a></span>
loss of their independence,—I venture to point out the impolicy
and injustice of interfering with these principalities.</p>

<p>I have already referred to a letter from the venerable
chief of Nagyr, in which he strongly commends to my care
one of his sons, Raja Habibulla, as a well-wisher of the
English Government. Indeed, he has absolutely done
nothing to justify any attack on the integrity of his country;
and before we invade it other means to secure peace should
be tried. I have no doubt that I, for one, could induce
him to comply with everything in reason, if reason, and not
an excuse for taking his country, is desired. Nagyr has
never joined Hunza in kidnapping expeditions, as is alleged
in the above-quoted paragraph. Indeed, slavery is an
abomination to the pious and peaceful agriculturist of that
interesting country. The Nagyris are musical and were fond
of dances, polo, ibex <i>battue</i>-hunting, archery and shooting
from horseback, and other manly exercises; but the growing
piety of the race has latterly proscribed music and dancing.
The accompanying drawing of a Nagyri dance in the
neighbouring Gilgit gives a good idea of similar performances
at Nagyr.</p>

<p>The country is full of legendary lore, but less so than
Hunza, where Grimm’s fairy tales appear to be translated
into actual life. No war is undertaken except at the
supposed command of an unseen fairy, whose drum is on
such occasions sounded in the mountains. Ecstatic women,
inhaling the smoke of a cedar-branch, announce the future,
tell the past, and describe the state of things in neighbouring
valleys. They are thus alike the prophets, the historians,
and the journalists of the tribe. They probably now tell
their indignant hearers how, under the pretext of shooting
or of commerce, Europeans have visited their country,
which they now threaten to destroy with strange and
murderous weapons; but Hunza is “ayeshó,” or “heaven-born,”
and the fairies, if not the inaccessible nature of the
country, will continue to protect it.</p>

<p>The folly of invading Hunza and Nagyr is even greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_9" id="Appendix_1_Page_9">[9]</a></span>
than the physical obstacles to which I have already referred.
Here, between the Russian and the British spheres of influence
in Central Asia, we have not only the series of
Pamirs, or plateaux and high valleys, which I first brought
to notice on linguistic grounds, in the map accompanying
my tour in Dardistan in 1866 (the country between
Kashmir and Kabul), and which have been recently confirmed
topographically; but we have also a large series of
mountainous countries, which, if left alone, or only assured
of our help against a foreign invader, would guarantee for
ever the peace alike of the Russian, the British, and the
Chinese frontiers. Unfortunately, we have allowed Afghanistan
to annex Badakhshan, Raushan, Shignan, and
Wakhan, at much loss of life to their inhabitants; and Russia
has similarly endorsed the shadowy and recent claims of Bokhara
on neighbouring provinces, like Darwáz and Karategin.</p>

<p>It is untrue that Hunza and Nagyr were ever tributaries
of Kashmîr, except in the sense that they occasionally sent
a handful of gold dust to its Maharaja, and received substantial
presents in return. It is to China or Kitái that
Hunza considers itself bound by an ancient, but vague,
allegiance. Hunza and Nagyr, that will only unite against
a foreign common foe, have more than once punished
Kashmîr when attempting invasion; but they are not hostile
to Kashmîr, and Nagyr even sends one of the princes to
Srinagar as a guarantee of its peaceful intentions. At the
same time, it is not very many months ago that they gave
us trouble at Chalt, when we sought to establish an outpost,
threatening the road to Hunza and the independence
alike of Hunza and Nagyr.</p>

<p>Just as Nagyr is pious, so Hunza is impious. Its religion
is a perversion even of the heterodox Mulái faith,
which is Shiah Muhammadan only in name, but pantheistic
in substance. It prevails in Punyál, Zebak, Darwáz, etc.
The Tham, or Raja, of Hunza used to dance in a Mosque
and hold revels in it. Wine is largely drunk in Hunza,
and like the Druses of the Lebanon, the “initiated” Muláis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_10" id="Appendix_1_Page_10">[10]</a></span>
may consider nothing a crime that is not found out. Indeed,
an interesting connection can be established between
the doctrines of the so-called “Assassins” of the Crusaders,
which have been handed down to the Druses, and those
of the Muláis in various parts of the Hindukush. Their
spiritual chief gave me a few pages of their hitherto mysterious
Bible, the “Kelám-i-Pir,” in 1886, which I have
translated, and shortly intend to publish. All I can now
say is, that, whatever the theory of their faith, the practice
depends, as elsewhere, on circumstances and the character
of the race.</p>

<p>The language of Hunza and Nagyr solves many philological
puzzles. It is a prehistoric remnant, in which a
series of simple consonantal or vowel sounds stands for
various groups of ideas, relationships, etc. It establishes
the great fact, that customs and the historical and other
associations of a race are the basis of the so-called rules of
grammar. The cradle, therefore, of human thought as
expressed in language, whether of the Aryan, the Turanian,
or the Shemitic groups, is to be found in the speech of
Hunza-Nagyr; and to destroy this by foreign intervention,
which has already brought new diseases into the Hindukush,
as also a general linguistic deterioration, would be a
greater act of barbarism than to permit the continuance of
Hunza raiding on the Yarkand road. Besides, that raiding
can be stopped again, by closing the slave-markets of
Badakhshan, Bokhara, and Yarkand, or by paying a subsidy,
say of £1,000 per annum, to the Hunza chief.</p>

<p>Indeed, as has already been pointed out, the recrudescence
of kidnapping is largely due to the state of insecurity
and confusion caused by our desire to render the Afghan
and the Chinese frontiers conterminous with our own, in
the vain belief that the outposts of three large and distant
kingdoms, acting in concert, will keep Russia more effectively
out of India than a number of small independent
republics or principalities. Afghanistan may now be big,
but every so-called subject in her outlying districts is her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_11" id="Appendix_1_Page_11">[11]</a></span>
inveterate foe. As stated in a letter from Nevsky to the
Calcutta <i>Englishman</i>, in connection with Colonel Grambcheffsky’s
recent explorations:</p>

<p>“One and all, these devastated tribes are firm in their
conviction that the raids of their Afghan enemies were
prompted and supported by the gold of Abdur Rahman’s
English protectors. They will remember this on the plateau
of Pamir, and among the tribes of Kaffiristan.”</p>

<p>However colourable this statement may be as regards
Shignán, Raushan, and perhaps even Wakhan, I believe
that the Kafirs are still our friends. At the same time it
should not be forgotten that, owing to the closing of the
slave-markets in Central Asia, the sale of Shiah subjects
had temporarily stopped in Chitrál. The Kafirs were being
less molested by kidnapping Muhammadan neighbours; the
Hunzas went back to agriculture, which the Nagyris had
never abandoned; Kashmîr, India, and the Russian side of
Central Asia afforded no opening for the sale of human beings.
The insensate ambition of officials, British and Russian,
the gift of arms to marauding tribes and the destruction
of Kashmîr influence, have changed all this, and it is only
by a return to “masterly inactivity,” which does not mean the
continuance of the Cimmerian darkness that now exists as
to the languages and histories of the most interesting races
of the world, that the peace and pockets of three mighty
empires can be saved.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, it is to the interest of Russia to force
us into heavy military expenditure by false alarms; to create
distrust between ourselves and China by pretending that
Russia and England alone have civilizing missions in
Central Asia, with which Chinese tyranny would interfere;
to hold up before us the Will-o’-the-wisp of an impossible demarcation
of the Pamirs, and finally, to ally itself with China
against India. For let it not be forgotten, that once the
Trans-Siberian railway is completed, China will be like wax
in her hand; and that she will be compelled to place her immense
material in men and food at the disposal of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_12" id="Appendix_1_Page_12">[12]</a></span>
overawing, but, as far as the <i>personnel</i> is concerned, not
unamiable neighbour. The tribes, emasculated by our
overwhelming civilization, and driven into three large camps,
will no longer have the power of resistance that they now
possess separately.</p>

<p>Let us therefore leave intact the two great belts of territories
that Nature has raised for the preservation of peace
in Asia—the Pamir with its adjacent regions to the east
and west, and the zone of the Hindukush with its hives of
independent tribes, intervening between Afghanistan on
the one side and Kashmîr on the other, till India proper is
reached. This will never be the case by a foreign invader,
unless diplomatists “meddle and muddle,” and try to put
together what Nature has put asunder. What we require
is the cultivation of greater sympathy in our relations with
natives; and, comparing big things with small, it is to this
feeling that I myself owed my safety, when I put off the disguise
in which I crossed the Kashmîr frontier in 1866 into
countries then wrongly supposed by our Government to be
inhabited by cannibals. This charge was also made, with
equal error, by one tribe against the other. Then too, as
in 1886, the Indian Press spoke of Russian intrigues; but
then, as in 1886, I found the very name of Russia to be unknown,
except where it had been learnt from a Kashmîr
Munshi, who had no business to be there at all, as the treaty of
1846, by which we sold Kashmîr to Ghulab Singh, assigned
the Indus as his boundary on the west. Now, as to the
question as to “What and where are the Pamirs?” I have
already stated my view in a letter to the Editor of the
<i>Morning Post</i>, which I trust I may be allowed to quote:</p>

<p>“As some of the statements made at the Royal Geographical
Society are likely to cause a sense of false
security, as dangerous to peace as a false alarm, I write to
say that ‘Pamirs’ do not mean ‘deserts,’ or ‘broken valleys,’
and that they are not uninhabitable or useless for movements
of large bodies of men. They may be all this in
certain places, at certain periods of the year, and under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_13" id="Appendix_1_Page_13">[13]</a></span>
certain conditions; but had our explorers or statesmen paid
attention to the languages of this part of the world, as
they should in regard to every other with which they deal,
they would have avoided many idle conjectures and the
complications that may follow therefrom. I do not wish
them to refer to philologists who have never been to the
East, and who interpret ‘Pamir’ as meaning the ‘Upa-Meru’
Mountain of Indian mythology, but to the people
who frequent the Pamirs during the summer months, year
after year, for purposes of pasturage, starting from various
points, and who in their own languages (Yarkandi, Turki,
and Kirghiz) call the high plain, elevated valley, table-land, or
plateau which they come across ‘Pamir.’ There are, therefore,
in one sense many ‘Pamirs,’ and as a <i>tout-ensemble</i>,
one ‘Pamir,’ or geographically, <i>the</i> ‘Pamir.’ The legend of
the two brothers, ‘Alichur and Pamir,’ is merely a personification
of two plateaux. Indeed, the obvious and popular
idea which has always attached to the word ‘Pamir,’ is the
correct one, whether it is the geographical ‘roof of the
world,’ the ‘Bám-i-dunya’ of the poet, or the ‘Pamir-dunya’
of the modern journalist. We have, therefore, to
deal with a series of plateaux, the topographical limits of
which coincide with linguistic, ethnographical, and political
limits. To the North, the Pamirs have the Trans-Altaic
Mountain range marking the Turki element, under Russian
influence; the Panja river, by whatever name, on the West is
a Tadjik or Iranian Frontier [Affghan]. The Sarikol on the
East is a Tibetan, Mongolian, or Chinese Wall, and the South
is our natural frontier, the Hindukush, to go beyond which is
physical death to the Hindu, and political ruin to the holder
of India, as it also is certain destruction to the invader,
except by one pass, which I need not name, and which is
accessible from a Pamir. That the Pamirs are not uninhabitable
may be inferred from Colonel Grambcheffsky’s
account [which is published at length elsewhere in this issue
of the <span class="smcap">Asiatic Quarterly Review</span>]. A few passages from it
must now suffice:—‘The Pamir is far from being a wilderness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_14" id="Appendix_1_Page_14">[14]</a></span>
It contains a permanent population, residing in it both
summer and winter.’ ‘The population is increasing to a
marked extent.’ ‘Slavery on the Pamir is flourishing:
moreover, the principal contingents of slaves are obtained
from Chatrar, Jasen, and Kanshoot, chanates under the
protectorate of England.’ ‘On descending into Pamir we
found ourselves between the cordons of the Chinese and
Affghan armies.’ ‘The population of Shoognan, numbering
2,000 families, had fled to Pamir, hoping to find a refuge
in the Russian Provinces’ (from ‘the untold atrocities which
the Affghans were committing in the conquered provinces of
Shoognan,’ etc.). ‘I term the whole of the tableland “Pamir,”
in view of the resemblance of the valleys to each other.’</p>

<p>“The climate of the Pamirs is variable, from more than
tropical heat in the sun to arctic cold in the shade, and in
consequence, is alike provocative and destructive of life.
Dr. G. Capus, who crossed them from north to south, exactly
as Mr. Littledale has done, but several months in the year
before him, says in his ‘Observations Météorologiques sur
le Pamir,’ which he sent to the last Oriental Congress,—‘The
first general fact is the inconstancy of severe cold.
The nights are generally coldest just before sunrise.’ ‘We
found an extreme amplitude of 61 deg. between the absolute
minimum and maximum, and of 41 deg. between the minimum
and the maximum in the shade during the same day.’
‘The thermometer rises and falls rapidly with the height of
the sun.’ ‘Great cold is less frequent and persistent than
was believed to be the case at the period of the year dealt
with’ (March 13 to April 19), ‘and is compensated by
daily intervals of elevation of temperature, which permit
animal life, represented by a fairly large number of species,
and including man, to keep up throughout the winter under
endurable conditions.’ Yet ‘the water-streak of snow,
which has melted in contact with a dark object, freezes
immediately when put into the shadow of the very same
object.’ ... The solution of political difficulties in Central
Asia is not in a practically impossible, and certainly unmaintainable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_15" id="Appendix_1_Page_15">[15]</a></span>
demarcation of the Pamirs, but in the strengthening
of the autonomy of the most interesting races that inhabit
the series of Circassias that already guard the safety alike
of British, Chinese, and of Russian dominion or spheres of
influence in Central Asia.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Woking</span>, <i>Nov. 29</i>.</p>

<p>It is not impossible that the tribes may again combine
in 1892 as they did in 1866 to turn out the Kashmîr troops
from Gilgit. The want of wisdom shown in forcing on the
construction of a road from Chalt to Aliabad, in the centre
of Hunza, as announced in to-day’s <i>Times</i>, must bring on, if
not a confederation of the tribes against us, at any rate their
awakened distrust. It is doubtful whether it was ever expedient
to establish an outpost at Gilgit, and the carrying it
still farther to the traditional apple of discord, the holding of
Chalt, which commands the Hunza road, is still more impolitic.
As in Affghanistan, so here, whatever power does <i>not</i>
interfere is looked upon as the saviour from present evils.
Once we have created big agglomerations under Affghanistan,
or China, or Kashmir, we are liable to the dangers following
either on collapse, want of cohesion, treachery from
within, the ambitions of a few men at the respective courts,
or, as with us, to serious fluctuations in foreign politics due to
the tactics of English parties. The change, therefore, from
natural boundaries to the wirepulling of diplomatists at
Kabul, Peking, or Downing Street is not in the interests
of peace, of our empire, or of civilization. Besides, it should
not be forgotten that we have added an element of disturbance,
far more subtle than the Babu, to our frontier
difficulties. The timid Kashmîri is unsurpassed as an
intriguer and adventurer among tribes beyond his frontier.
The time seems to have arrived when, in the words of the
well-known Persian proverb,<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> the sparseness of races round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_16" id="Appendix_1_Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the Pamirs should bid us to be on our guard against the
Affghan, the “bad-raced” Kashmîrî, and the Kambó (supposed
to be the tribe on the banks of the Jhelum beyond Mozaffarabad).
Perhaps, however, the Kambó is the Heathen
Chinee; and the proverb would then be entirely applicable
to the present question. After the construction of the
Trans-Siberian Railway, Russia will be able to exert the
greatest pressure on China. The Russian strength at
Vladivostok is already enormous, and when the time comes
she can hurl an overwhelming force on what remains of
Chinese Manchuria, before which Chinese resistance will
melt like snow. Peking and the north of China are thus
quite at the mercy of Russia. She will find there the most
populous country of those she rules in Asia, and with ample
supplies. China has a splendid raw material, militarily
speaking; and Russia could there form the biggest army
that has ever been seen in Asia, to hold <i>in terrorem</i> over a
rival or to hurl at the possessions of a foe.</p>

<p>It is against such possibilities that the maintenance of
“masterly inactivity,” qualified by the moral and, if need
be, pecuniary or other material support of the Anglo-Indian
Government is needed. This is the object of this paper,
before I enter into the more agreeable task of describing
the languages, customs, and country of perhaps the most
interesting races that inhabit the globe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Times</i> of the 30th November publishes a map of
the Pamirs and an account of the questions connected with
them that, like many other statements in its articles on
“Indian affairs,” are incorrect and misleading. Having
been on a special mission by the Panjab Government, in
1866, when I discovered the races and languages of
“Dardistan,” and gave the country that name, and again
having been on special duty with the Foreign Department
of the Government of India in 1886 in connection with
the Boorishki language and race of Hunza, Nagyr, and a
part of Yasin, regarding which I have recently completed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_17" id="Appendix_1_Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Part I. of a large work, I may claim to speak with some
authority as regards these districts, even if I had no other
claim. The point which I wish to specially contradict at
present, is the one relating to the Russians bringing themselves
into almost direct contact with “the Hunza and other
tribes subject to Kashmîr and, as such, entitled to British
protection and under British control.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;" id="illus11">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Dr. Leitner as a Bukhara Maulvi,
when crossing the Frontier in 1866 during the Kashmîr War with
the Dard Tribes.</span></p>
</div>

<p>When I crossed the then Kashmîr frontier in 1866, in
the disguise of a Bokhara Maulvi, armed with a testimonial
of Muhammadan theological learning, I found that the
tribes of Hunza, Nagyr, Dareyl, Yasin, and Chitrál had
united under the leadership of the last-named to expel the
Kashmîr invaders from the Gilgit Fort. My mission was
a purely linguistic one; but the sight of dying and dead
men along the road, that of heads stuck up along the
march of the Kashmîr troops, and the attempts made on
my life by our feudatory, the late Maharaja of Kashmîr,
compelled me to pay attention to other matters besides
the languages, legends, songs, and fables of the interesting
races with whom I now came in contact under circumstances
that might not seem to be favourable to the accomplishment
of my task. I had been warned by the then
Lieutenant-Governor of the Panjab, Sir Donald McLeod,
whose like we have not seen again, not to cross the frontier,
as the tribes beyond were supposed to be cannibals; but as
I could not get the information of which I was in search
within our frontier, I had to cross it. My followers were
frightened off by all sorts of wild stories, till our party was
reduced from some fifty to three, including myself. The
reason for all this was, that the Maharaja was afraid that
I should find out and report his breach of the Treaty by
which we sold Kashmîr to him in 1846, and in which the
Indus is laid down as his boundary on the west. In 1866,
therefore, at any rate, even the tenure of Gilgit, which is
on the other side of the Indus, was contested and illegal,
whilst the still more distant Hunza and Nagyr had more
than once inflicted serious punishment on the Kashmîr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_18" id="Appendix_1_Page_18">[18]</a></span>
troops that sought to invade districts that have preserved
their autonomy during the last fourteen centuries, as was
admitted by <i>The Times</i> of the 2nd November, 1891, before
its present change with the times, if an unintentional pun
may be permitted.</p>

<p>Then, as ever, the Anglo-Indian newspapers spoke of
Russian intrigues in those regions. I am perfectly certain
that if, instead of the fussiness of our statesmen and the
sensationalism of our journals, the languages, history, and
relations of these little-known races had been studied by
them, we should never have heard of Russia in that part of
the East. It is also not by disingenuousness and short
cuts on maps or in diplomacy, but by <i>knowledge</i>, that
physical, ethnographical, and political problems are to be
solved; nor will the bold and brilliant robberies of Russia
be checked by our handing over the inhabitants of the
supposed “cradle of the human race” to Affghan, Kashmîr,
or Chinese usurpations. Above all, it is a loss of time to
palm off myths as history in order to suit the policy or
conceal the ignorance of the moment.</p>

<p>Just as little as Darwaz and Karategin are ancestral
dominions of Bokhara, and, therefore, under Russian influence,
so little did even Badakhshan, and much less so,
Raushan, Shignan, and Wakhan, ever really belong to
Affghanistan. As for the Chinese hold on Turkistan, we
ourselves denied it when we coquetted with Yakub Khush
Begi, though Kitái was ever the acknowledged superior
of Eastern Turkistan. If Hunza admits any allegiance,
it is to China, and not to Kashmîr; and the designations
of offices of rule in that country are of Chinese, and not of
Aryan origin, including even “Thàm,” the title of its Raja.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, the vast number of tribes
that inhabit the many countries between the Indus and the
Kuner own no master except their own tribal head or the
tribal council. From kidnapping Hunza, where the right to
plunder is monarchical, hereditary, and “ayeshó” = “heaven-born,”
to the peace and learning of republican Kandiá or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_19" id="Appendix_1_Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Gabriál, all want to be left alone. If a neighbour becomes
troublesome, he is raided on till an interchange of presents
restores harmony. It is impossible to say that either side
is tributary to the other. The wealthier gives the larger
present; the bigger is considered the superior in a general
sort of way, and so two horses, two dogs, and a handful of
gold dust are yearly sent by Hunza to Kashmîr or to Yarkand
as a cloak for much more substantial exactions in return.
Nagyr sends a basket of apricots instead of the horses and
dogs. In 1871 Chitrál still paid a tribute to Badakhshan
in slaves, but it would be absurd to infer from this fact that
Chitrál ever acknowledged the suzerainty of Jehandar Shah,
or of the Affghan faction that dispossessed him. Nor were
the Khaibaris, or other highway robbers, our rulers, because
we paid them blackmail, or they our subjects because they
might bring us “sweetmeats.”</p>

<p>The points in which most Englishmen are as deficient
as Russians are generally proficient, are language and a
sympathetic manner with natives. That, however, linguistic
knowledge is not useless may be inferred from the fact that
it enabled me, to use the words of my Chief, Commissary
General H. S. Jones, C.B., during the Russian War in 1855,
“to pass unharmed through regions previously unknown
and among tribes hitherto unvisited by any European.”</p>

<p>Also in topography and geography linguistics are necessary;
and the absurd mistakes now made at certain learned
societies and in certain scientific journals, regarding the
Pamirs, would be avoided by a little study of the Oriental
languages concerned. In 1866, the map which accompanies
my philological work on “Dardistan” shows, on linguistic
grounds, and on the basis of native itineraries, the various
Pamirs that have been partially revealed within the last
few weeks, or have been laboriously ascertained by expensive
Russian and British expeditions between 1867
and 1890. The publication of my material, collected at my
own expense and which shall no longer be delayed, would
have saved many complications; but when, <i>e.g.</i>, I pointed out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_20" id="Appendix_1_Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in 1866, that the Indus, after leaving Bunji, ran west instead
of south, as on the then existing maps, I got into trouble
with the Topographical Survey, which “discovered” the
fact through its well-known “Mulla” in 1876. The salvation
of India that is not made “departmentally” is crucified;
and whoever does not belong to the regular military or civil
services has no business to know or to suggest. Mr. Curzon,
when presiding at a meeting of the late Oriental Congress,
assured us that a new era had risen; but only the other
night, at the Royal Geographical Society, a complaint was
made of the reluctance of official departments in giving
the Society information. As a rule, the mysteriousness of
offices only conceals their ignorance, of which we have an
instance in Capt. Younghusband being sent to shut the
passes after the Russians had already stolen a march on, or
through, them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The neutralization of the Pamirs is the only solution of a
difficulty created by the conjectural treaties of diplomatists
and the ambition of military emissaries. Left as a huge
happy hunting-ground for sportsmen, or as pasturage for
nomads from whatever quarter, the Pamirs form the most
perfect “neutral zone” conceivable. That the wanderings
of these nomads should be accompanied by territorial or political
claims, whether by Russia, China, Affghanistan, Kashmir,
or ourselves, is the height of absurdity. As for Hunza-Nagyr,
the sooner they are left to themselves the better
for us, who are not bound to help Kashmîr in encroaching
on them. Kashmîr managed them very fairly after 1848;
and when it was occasionally defeated, its prestige did not
suffer, for the next summer invariably found the tribal envoys
again suing for peace and presents. The sooner the Gilgit
Agency is withdrawn, the greater will be our reputation
for fair dealing. Besides, we can take hostages from the
Chiefs’ families as guarantees of future tranquillity. Hunza-Nagyr
are certainly not favourable to Russia, whilst Nagyr
is decidedly friendly to us. The sensational account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_21" id="Appendix_1_Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Colonel Grambcheffsky’s visit to Hunza, which he places on
his map where Nagyr is, seems to be one of the usual traps
to involve us in great military expenditure and to alienate
the tribes from us. It is also not creditable that, for party
or personal purposes, the peaceful and pious Nagyris,—whom
our own Gilgit Resident, Colonel Biddulph, has reported on
as distinguished for “timidity and incapacity for war,” “never
having joined the Hunza raids,” “slavery being unknown in
Nagyr,”—should be described as “kidnappers,” “raiders
along with Hunza,” “slave-dealers,” “robbers,” and “scoundrels,”—statements
made by a correspondent from Gilgit in
a morning newspaper of to-day, and to all of which I give an
unqualified contradiction.</p>

<p>The establishment of the Gilgit Agency has already drawn
attention to the shortest road for the invasion of India; and
it is significant that its advocate at Gilgit should admit that
all the tribes of the Indus Valley “sympathized with the
Hunzas,” from whose depredations they are erroneously supposed
to have suffered, and that they were likely “to attack
the British from behind by a descent on the Gilgit road” to
Kashmîr. Why should “the only other exit from Gilgit by
way of the Indus Valley be through territories held by tribes
hostile to the British”? Have the Gilgit doings already
alienated the poor, but puritanical Chilásis, tributaries of
Kashmîr, who adjoin our settled British district of Kaghan?
Are we to dread the Republic of Muhammadan learning,
Kandiá, that has not a single fort; pastoral Dareyl; the
Koli-Palus traders; agricultural Tangir, and other little
Republics—one only of eleven houses? As for the places
beyond them, our officials at Attock, Peshawur, Rawalpindi,
and Abbottabad will deal with the Pathan tribes in their
own neighbourhood, which have nothing to do with the
adjoining Republics of quiet, brave, and intelligent Dards, on
both sides of the Indus, up to Gilgit, to which I have referred,
and which deserve our respectful study, sympathy,
and unobtrusive support.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following account, published by Reuter’s Telegram Company, will
supplement the preceding article:—</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Woking</span>, <i>Dec. 13</i>.</p>

<p>“A representative of Reuter’s Agency interviewed Dr. Leitner at his residence at
Woking to-day, with the object of eliciting some information on the subject of the Hunza
and Nagyr tribes, with whom the British forces are at present in conflict.</p>

<p>“Dr. Leitner, it is needless to say, is the well-known discoverer of the races and
languages of Dardistan (the country between Kabul and Kashmir), which he so named
when sent on a linguistic mission by the Punjab Government in 1864, at a time when the
various independent tribes, including Hunza and Nagyr, had united in order to turn the
troops of the Maharaja of Kashmir out of Gilgit. At that time it was considered that
the treaty of 1846, by which Great Britain sold Kashmir to the Maharaja, had confined
him to the Indus as his westward boundary, and had therefore rendered his occupation
of Gilgit an encroachment and breach of treaty.</p>

<p>“Dr. Leitner, although the country was in a state of war, which is not favourable to
scientific research, managed to collect a mass of information, and a fine ethnographical
collection, which is at the museum at Woking. He has also made many friends in the
country, and is doubtless the highest, if not the only, authority regarding these countries.</p>

<p>“Dr. Leitner, who was quite unprepared for to-day’s visit, said that the relations
which he had kept up with the natives of Gilgit, Hunza, Nagyr, and Yasin forced him
to the conclusion that a conflict had been entered into which might have easily been
avoided by a little more sympathy and knowledge, especially of the Nagyr people. Indeed,
it was not a light matter that could have induced the venerable chief of Nagyr to
make common cause with his hereditary foe of Hunza, unless he feared that the British
threatened their respective independence.</p>

<p>“Not many weeks ago Dr. Leitner received a letter from the chief of Nagyr, in which
he recommended to his kind attention his son, now in Kashmir, on the ground that he,
even more so than any other member of his numerous family, was a well-wisher to the
British Government. At that time the chief could not have had any feelings of animosity,
although he might have protested, together with his rival of Hunza, against the British
occupation of Chalt. In fact, it was not true that Nagyr and Hunza were really subject
to Kashmir, except in the vague way in which these States constantly recognised the
suzerainty of a neighbouring power in the hope of getting substantial presents for their
offerings of a few ounces of gold dust, a couple of dogs, or basket of apricots, etc. Thus
Chitrál, the ally of Great Britain, used to pay a tribute of slaves to the Ameers of
Badakshan; but it would be absurd on that ground to render Chitrál a part of Afghanistan,
because Badakshan now, in a manner, belongs to Abdurrahman. Hunza, again,
sends a tribute to China; and, in a general way, China is the only Power that ever had
a shadow of claim on these countries, but it is a mere shadow. Dr. Leitner said, the
only policy for Great Britain is, in the words of the Secretary of State or Viceroy, ‘to
maintain and strengthen all the indigenous Governments.’ This policy he would extend
to the triangle which has Peshawur for its base, and thereby interpose a series of almost
impregnable mountainous countries, which would be sufficiently defended by the independence
of their inhabitants. If Circassia could oppose Russia for thirty years, even
although Russia had the command of the Black Sea, how much more effective would be
the resistance of the innumerable Circassias which Providence had placed between ourselves
and the Russian frontier in Asia? We ought to have made these tribes look upon
us as a distant but powerful friend, ready to help them in an emergency; but now, by
attacking two of them, we caused Russia to be looked upon as the coming Saviour; indeed,
the people of Wakhan, on the Pamir side of Hunza, were already doing so, whilst
Shignan and Roshan, which had been almost depopulated by our friends, the Afghans,
had already begun to emigrate into Russian territory. Here Dr. Leitner added that the
Russian claims through Bokhara were as illusory as those of Kashmir, and historically
even less founded than those of China. Indeed, no one had a right to these countries
except the indigenous peoples and chiefs who inhabited them; and in this scramble for
the regions round the Pamir, great Britain was simply breaking down her natural defences
by stamping out the independence of native tribes and making military roads; for
it was the absence of those roads on the British side that rendered it impossible to an
invader to do England any real harm or to advance on India proper.</p>

<p>Asked why the trouble had broken out at the present time, Dr. Leitner said, that he
had been kept without information of the immediate cause, but he felt certain that it was
owing to the attempt to construct a military road to Hunza, whereby England would only
facilitate the advent of a possible invader from that direction, besides making Hunza
throw in its lot with that invader. It was perfectly untrue, as alleged in some of the
Indian papers, that the Nagyris were kidnappers, and that our attack would be an advantage
to the cause of anti-slavery. The fact was just the other way. Kidnapping had
been stopped in 1869 as far as Hunza was concerned.</p>

<p>The Nagyris never raided at all; Chitrál also gave up selling its Káfir or Shiah
subjects into slavery when the markets of Badakshan were closed; but now that confusion
had caused the English and Russian advance, Hunza had again taken to raiding, and
Chitrál to selling slaves. As for Nagyr, the case was quite different; they were an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_23" id="Appendix_1_Page_23">[23]</a></span>
excellent people and very quiet, so much so that Colonel Biddulph, the Resident, described
them as “noted for timidity and incapacity for war,” whereas in his “Tribes of the Hindu
Kush” he also states that the people of Hunza are not warlike in the sense in which the
Afghans are said to be so. No doubt the Nagyris dislike war, but would fight bravely if
driven to do so. Colonel Biddulph adds: “They are settled agricultural communities,
proud of the independence they have always maintained for fourteen centuries, hemmed
in by lofty mountains, and living under rulers who boast of long, unbroken descent from
princes of native blood.” He also bears testimony to the fact that “the Nagyr people
were never concerned in these raids, and slavery does not exist among them.” At the
same time Dr. Leitner fully admitted that the Hunza people were not a model race,
since they used to be desperate raiders and kidnappers, and very immoral and impious.
The father of the present king used to dance in a state of drunkenness in the mosque; but,
on the other hand, we were not bound to be the reformers of Hunza by pulling down one
of the bulwarks to our Indian Empire. Hunza was a picturesque country in every sense;
it was nominally governed by fairies: ecstatic women were the prophetesses of the tribe,
recounted its past glories, and told what was going on in the neighbouring valleys, so
they were its historians and journalists as well as its prophetesses. No war was undertaken
unless the fairies gave their consent, and the chief fairy, Yudeni, who protects the
“Tham” (a Chinese title), has no doubt already struck the sacred drum in order to call
the men of the country to defend the “Heaven-born,” as their chief is called. The two
“Thams” of Hunza and Nagyr, who have a common ancestry, are also credited with the
power of causing rain, and there would certainly appear to be some foundation for this
remarkable fact.</p>

<p>The two tribes are great polo players; archery on horseback is common amongst
them; and they are very fair ibex hunters.</p>

<p>The people of Nagyr are as pious and gentle as those of Hunza are the contrary.
Their language went back to simple sounds as indicative of a series of human relations
or experiences, and clearly showed that the customs and associations of a race were at the
basis of so-called rules of grammar. Nothing more wonderful than their language could
be conceived; it went to the root of human thought as expressed in language, but the
language had already suffered by foreign influences between 1866, when one son of the
Rajah of Nagyr taught him, and 1886, when another son of the Rajah continued his
lessons.</p>

<p>As regards religion, the Hunzas are Mulais, a mysterious and heretical sect, akin to
the Druses of the Lebanon, practising curious rites, and practically infidels. He had
obtained a few pages of their secret Bible, the Kelam-i-pir, which throws much light on
the doctrines of the so-called “assassins” during the Crusades. The Nagyris are pious
Muhammadans of the Shiah denomination.</p>

<p>Dr. Leitner then showed the map accompanying his linguistic work on Dardistan.
After comparing it with the most recent Russian and British maps, that of Dr. Leitner
gives the fullest and clearest information, not only as regards Hunza-Nagyr, where all
the places where fighting has occurred are marked, but also as regards the various
Pamirs, thus anticipating in 1866 on linguistic grounds and native itineraries the different
Pamirs that have recently been settled geographically. It shows that the ethnographical
frontier of the Pamirs to the north are the Turki-speaking nomads of the trans-Altaic
range (now Russian); to the west the Persian, or Tajiks (now Afghan); to the south
the Aryan Hindu Kush [British]; and to the east the wall of the Serikol Mountains,
dividing or admitting Chinese, Tibetan, or Mongolian influence. The indeterminate
river courses through the Pamir, or a line stretched across its plateaux, valleys, and
mountains, are obviously an unmaintainable demarcation, which is liable to be transgressed
by shepherds under whatever rule; but the whole of the Pamirs together, as a huge and
happy hunting-ground, are, no doubt, if neutralized by the three Powers concerned, the
best possible frontier, as “no man’s land,” and a perfect neutral zone. “What matter,”
continued Dr. Leitner, “if the passes are easy of access on the Russian side, it is on the
descent, and on the ascent on our side that almost insuperable difficulties begin. Where
we are now fighting in Hunza-Nagyr only the low state of the river which divides Hunza
from Nagyr enables us to make a simultaneous advance on both. Otherwise we should
have to let ourselves man by man down from one ledge of rock to another, and if we
miss our footing be whirled away in the most terrible torrent the imagination can conceive.
Why, then, destroy such a great defence in our favour if Hunza is kept friendly,
as it so easily can be, especially with the pressure exercised on it by the Nagyris,
whose forts frown on those of Hunza all down the river that separates their countries?
I cannot conceive anything more wanton or suicidal than the present advance even if we
should succeed in removing one of the most important landmarks in the history of the
human race by shooting down the handful of Nagyris and Hunzas that oppose us. They
preserve the pre-historic remnants of legends and customs that explain much that is still
obscure in the life and history of European races. A few hundred pounds a year judiciously
spent and the promise of the withdrawal of the Gilgit Agency, which was
already once before attacked when under Colonel Biddulph, would be a far better way of
securing peace than shooting down with Gatlings and Martini-Henry rifles people who
defend their independence within their crags with bows, arrows, battleaxes, and a few
muskets; and promise of the withdrawal of the Gilgit Agency might be contingent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_1_Page_24" id="Appendix_1_Page_24">[24]</a></span>
upon the increase of the number of hostages belonging to the chiefs’ families that
are now annually sent to Kashmir as a guarantee of friendly relations.</p>

<p>The Hunzas and Nagyris are not to be despised as foes; they are very good marksmen.
In 1886, when the Kashmir troops thought they had cleared the plain before the Gilgit
Fort entirely of enemies, and not a person was to be seen outside it, the tribesmen would
glide along the ground unperceived behind a stone pushed in front of them, and resting
their old flint muskets on them shoot off the Maharajah’s Sepoys whenever they showed
themselves outside the fort. Indeed, it was this circumstance that induced Dr. Leitner
to abandon the protection of the fort and make friends with the tribesmen outside. All
the tribes desired was to be left alone in their mountain fastnesses. They had sometimes
internecine feuds, but would unite against the common foe. It was merely emasculating
their powers of resistance to subject them, either on the one side to Bokhara, which
meant Russia, or to Afghanistan or Kashmir, which meant Great Britain, or to China,
which meant dependence on a Power that might be utilized any day against Great Britain
after the completion of the trans-Siberian railway. Diplomatists, frontier delimitation
commissions, and officers, both British and Russian, anxious for promotion, had, continued
Dr. Leitner, created the present confusion; and it was now high time to rely
rather on the physical obstacles that guaranteed the safety alike of the British, Russian,
and Chinese frontiers than on the chapter of political accidents.</p>

<p>Dr. Leitner, who is going to give a lecture at the Westminster Town-hall to-morrow
afternoon on “The Races, Religions, and Politics of the Pamir Regions,” then showed our
representative Col. Grambcheffsky’s map, which put Hunza where Nagyr ought to be, and
ignored the latter place altogether, just as did the last map of the Geographical Society
in connection with Mr. Littledale’s tour. Grambcheffsky’s map, however, had since been
corrected by evidently an English map, and it was strange that Russians had easier access
to English maps than Englishmen themselves. In fact, all this secrecy, Dr. Leitner
maintained, was injurious to the acquisition of full knowledge regarding imperfectly known
regions. Attention was then directed to a number of maps, that of Mr. Drew, a Kashmir
official, showing Hunza-Nagyr to be beyond Kashmir influence. This was practically
confirmed by several official maps and the statements of Colonels Biddulph and Hayward,
the latter of whom placed the Kashmir frontier towards Hunza at Nomal, whilst the
British are now fighting sixteen and a half miles beyond in front of Mayun, where the
first Hunza fort is. The Nagyr frontier Dr. Leitner places at Jaglot, which is nineteen
miles from Nilt, where we are simultaneously fighting the first Nagyr fort.</p>

<p>Dr. Leitner, in conclusion, expressed his conviction, from his knowledge of the people
concerned, that any one with a sympathetic mind could get them to do anything in reason;
but that encroachments, whether overt or covert, would be resisted to the utmost. Indeed,
England’s restlessness had brought on the present trouble.</p>

<p>In 1866, he stated, the very name of Russia was unknown in these parts, and in 1886
was only known to a few. Yet the English Press in both these years spoke of Russian
intrigues among the tribes. He did not fear them as long as the Indian Empire relied on
its natural defences, its inner strength, and on justice to its chiefs and people, and as
long as its policy with the tribes was guided by knowledge and good feeling.</p>

<h3 id="APPENDIX_II">APPENDIX II.<br />
<span class="smaller">NOTES ON RECENT EVENTS IN CHILÁS AND CHITRÁL.</span></h3>

<p>In 1866 I was sent by the Punjab Government on a linguistic
mission to Kashmir and Chilás at the instance of
the Bengal Asiatic Society and on the motion of the late
Sir George Campbell, who hoped to identify Kailás or the
Indian Olympus with Chilás.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Although unable to support
that conjecture, I collected material which was published in
Part I. of my “Dardistan” and which the Government declared
“as throwing very considerable and important light
on matters heretofore veiled in great obscurity.” That
some obscurity still exists, is evident from the <i>Times</i>
telegram of to-day (5th December, 1892), in which an item
of news from the Tak [Takk] valley is described as coming
from <i>Chitrál</i>, a distant country with which Chilás has
nothing to do. The Takk village is fortified, and through
the valley is the shortest and easiest road to our British
district of Kaghán. It is alleged that some headmen of
Takk wished to see Dr. Robertson at Gilgit, who thereupon
sent a raft to bring them, but the raft was fired on and
Capt. Wallace, who went to its assistance, was wounded.
[Chilás is on the Kashmir side of the Indus, and the
Gilgit territory is reached by crossing the Indus at Bunji.]</p>

<p>The incident is ascribed either to “<i>the treachery of the
men who professed willingness to <span class="smcap">come in</span></i>” or to the mischievousness
of “other persons.” It is probable from this
suggestion of treachery and the unconscious use of the words
“to come in,” which is the Anglo-Indian equivalent for
“surrender,” that the headmen of Takk were <i>not</i> willing to
make over their Fort to the British or to open the road to
Gilgit. The Takk incident, therefore, is not a part of the
so-called “<i>Chitrál usurpation</i>,” under which heading it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_2_Page_2" id="Appendix_2_Page_2">[2]</a></span>
immediately appears, but is a part of <i>our</i> usurpation on the
tribes inhabiting the banks of the Indus. In 1843, these
tribes inflicted a severe loss on the Sikh invaders, and
in my “history of the wars with Kashmir” the part
taken by the manly defenders of Takk, now reduced from
131 to some 90 houses, is given in detail. It seems to
me that as the Gilgit force was unable to support “the
Chitrál usurpation” of our protégé, Afzul-ul-Mulk, owing
to his being killed by his uncle Sher Afzul, it is to be
employed to coerce the Indus tribes to open out a road
which ought never to have been withdrawn from their
hold. About 50 years ago the Takk men were stirred
into so-called rebellion by Kashmir agents in order to
justify annexation. It is to be hoped that history will not
repeat itself, or that, at any rate, the next 50 years will see
the Indus tribes as independent and peaceful as they have
been since 1856, especially in Chilás (before 1892), and as
mysterious as Hunza ought to have remained till our unnecessary
attack on that country caused practically unknown
Russia to be looked upon as the Saviour of Nations “rightly
struggling to be free” (see Baron Vrevsky’s reply to the
Hunza deputation). <i>Quem Deus vult perdere, prius dementat</i>;
and no greater instance of folly can be conceived,
than the construction of a military road through countries
in which the chamois is often puzzled for its way. Nor
was the attention of the Russians drawn to them before
we made our own encroachments.</p>

<p>As for the Pamirs, whatever may be the present interpretation
of Prince Gortchakoff’s Convention, the Russians were
unwilling to let political consequences or limits accompany
the erratic wanderings of Kirghiz sheep in search of pasturage
in that region. Prince Gortchakoff’s advocacy of a
Neutral Zone and of the autonomy of certain tribes was
justified by the facts (which he, however, rather guessed
than knew) and was worthy alike of that Diplomatist and
of our acceptance in the interests of India and of peace.
The incorporation of certain Districts in the domain, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_2_Page_3" id="Appendix_2_Page_3">[3]</a></span>
under the sphere of influence, of Afghanistan, was distasteful
to tribes attached to their hereditary rulers or to republican
institutions and was not too willingly accepted by the
Amir of Afghanistan, who now expects us to defend the
white Elephants that we have given him better than we
did Panjdeh. Some Muláis that had fled from Russian
tyranny to Afghan territory assured me that “the finger of
an Afghan was more oppressive than the whole Russian
army.” Indeed, so far as Central Asia is concerned, Russia,
with the exception of certain massacres, has hitherto behaved,
on the whole, as a great civilizing power.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>As for Sirdar Nizám-ul-Mulk, this is his <i>name</i> and not
his <i>title</i>. He is the “Mihtar” or “Prince” Nizám-ul-Mulk,
and neither an Indian “Sirdár” nor a “Nizám.” He is also
the “Badshah” of Turikoh, this being the district assigned
to him in his father’s lifetime as the heir-apparent. He was
snubbed by us for offering to relieve that excellent officer,
Col. Lockhart, when a prisoner in Wakhan! He has written
to me from Turikoh for “English phrases and words with
their Persian equivalents as a pleasure and a requirement.”
This does not look like hostility to the British. He spoke
to me in 1886 of his brother Afzul’s bravery with affection
and pride, though he has ever maintained his own acknowledged
right as the successor of his father Amán-ul-Mulk.
If he has been alienated from us or has ever been tempted
to throw himself into the arms of Russia, it has most
assuredly been our fault. Besides, just as we have abandoned
the Shiah Hazaras, our true friends during the late
Afghan War, to be destroyed by their religious and political
foe, the Sunni Amir Abdurrahman, so have the Amir Sher
Ali and the Tham of Hunza, Safdar Ali Khan, rued their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_2_Page_4" id="Appendix_2_Page_4">[4]</a></span>
trust in Russian Agents. I regret, therefore, to find in the
<i>Times</i> telegram of to-day that “the Nizám” “is acting
without the support of the British Agent” “who has not
interfered,” when he had already interfered in favour of
the usurper Afzul-ul-Mulk.</p>

<p>As for the connivance of Amir Abdurrahman, my “rough
history of Dardistan from 1800 to 1872” shows that, in one
sense, Chitrál is tributary to Badakhshán and as we have
assigned Badakhshán to the Amir, he, no doubt, takes an
interest in Chitrál affairs. I believe, however, that interest
to be somewhat platonic, and he knows that his friend
Jehandár Shah (the late wrongfully deposed hereditary ruler
of Badakhshán) never paid any tribute to Afghanistan. But
Chitrál once also paid tribute to Dîr, with whose able Chief,
Rahmat-ullah-Khan, “the Nizám” is connected by marriage.
Chitrál on the other hand has <i>received</i> a subsidy from
Kashmir since 1877, but this was as much a tribute from
Kashmir to Aman-ul-Mulk, as a sign of his subjection to
Kashmir, for shortly after he made offers of allegiance to
Kabul. With all alike it is</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The good old rule, the simple plan,</div>
<div class="verse">That they should take who have the power</div>
<div class="verse">And they should keep who can.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is misleading to speak of their relations to neighbouring
States as “tributary.” Are the Khyberis tributary
to us or we to them, because we pay them a tribute to
let our merchants travel through their Pass? Have we
never ourselves come, first as suppliants, then as merchants,
then as guests, then as advisers, then as protectors, and,
finally, as conquerors?</p>

<p>The procedure of Afghanistan, of Chitrál, of Kashmir,
and of our own is very much alike and so are the several
radii of influence of the various factors in “the question.”
We have our fringe of independent frontier tribes with
whom we flirt, or wage war, as suits the convenience of the
moment. Afghanistan has a similar fringe of independent
Ishmaelites round it and even through it, whose hands are
against everybody and everybody’s hands against them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_2_Page_5" id="Appendix_2_Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Chitrál is threatened all along its line by the Kafirs, who
even make a part of Badakhshán insecure, but are nevertheless
our very good friends. Kashmir has its fringe on
its extreme border, especially since, in violation of our treaty
of 1846, it has attacked countries <i>beyond the Indus on the
west</i>, including the Kunjûtis of Hunza, who resumed their
raiding—which had ceased in 1867—during and after
Col. Lockhart’s visit in 1886. Yet there can be little
doubt about “the loyalty” of those concerned. The
Amirs of Afghanistan consider themselves “<i>shields of
India</i>,” as I have heard two of them say, and so did our
Ally of Kashmir, who ought never to have been reduced to
a subordinate feudatory position. What wonder then that
old Amán-ul-Mulk of Chitrál should also have tried to
become a buffer between Afghanistan on the West,
Kashmir on the East, India on the South and, latterly,
Russia in the North, if indeed the whole story of Russian
intrigue in Chitrál be at all truer than a similar mare’s nest
which we discovered in Hunza? It is the policy of Russia
to create false alarms and thereby to involve us in expenditure,
whilst standing by and posing as the future saviour of
the tribes. Our tendency to compromises and subservient
Commissions of delimitation and to “scuttling” occasionally,
is also well known and so we are offered in Russian
papers “<i>an Anglo-Russian understanding on the subject of
Chitrál</i>,” as if Chitrál was not altogether out of the sphere
of Russia’s legitimate influence! It is also amusing to
find in the <i>Novosti</i> that Russia’s sole desire is “to prevent
<i>Afghanistan</i> from falling into British hands.” We are
already spending at Gilgit on food etc. for our troops more
in one year than were spent in the 40 years of the so-called
mismanagement of Kashmir, which I myself steadily exposed,
but which kept the frontier far more quiet than it has been
since the revival of the Gilgit Agency. There is every
prospect now of heavier and continued expenditure as the
policy of the Foreign Department of the Government of
India develops. On that policy a <i>veto</i> should at once be put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_2_Page_6" id="Appendix_2_Page_6">[6]</a></span>
by the British Parliament and public, if our present Liberal
Administration cannot do so without pressure from without.
We should conciliate Nizam-ul-Mulk before it is too late.
He is connected with Umra Khan of Jandôl and with the
influential Mullah Shahu of Bajaur through his maternal
uncle, Kokhan Beg. He has also connections in Badakhshan,
Hunza and Dîr, as already stated. Indeed, we ought to
have given him our support from the beginning. I doubt
whether it would be desirable to subdivide Chitrál as
stated in to-day’s <i>Times</i>, letting Sher Afzul keep Chitrál
proper, giving Yasin to “the Nizám” and letting Umra
Khan retain what he has already seized of Southern Chitrál.
As for Sher Afzul, I believe, that he is also “loyal.”</p>

<p>As for Hunza, I am not at all certain that the fugitive,
Safdar Ali Khan, really murdered his father. At all
events when the deed was committed, I find that it was
attributed to Muhammad Khan,<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> probably not the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_2_Page_7" id="Appendix_2_Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Mir Muhammad Nazim who has acknowledged the
suzerainty of England (through Kashmir) and of China.
The latter power has always had something to say to
Hunza, and the very title of its Chief “Tham” is of
Chinese origin. The subsidy that China used to pay for
keeping open the commercial road from Badakhshan and
Wakhan through the Pamirs along Kunjût (Hunza) to
Yarkand, was about £380 per annum, and this sum was
divided between four States and ensured the immunity
of the route from raids.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> I doubt whether in future
£380 a year on Hunza alone will enable us to keep it
quiet, and I am sure that the lofty superciliousness with
which Chinese officials discuss the Pamir question, as
something that scarcely concerns them, is no evidence of
that pertinacious power abandoning claims to a suzerainty
in those regions which are historically founded, although
their exercise has been more by an appeal to imagination
of the glorious and invincible, if distant, “Khitái,” than
by actual interference.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is China alone that has a grievance—against
Russia for the occupation of the Alichur Pamir—against
Afghanistan for expelling her troops from Somatash (of
subsequent Yanoff fame)—and against England for encroaching
on her ancient feudatory of Hunza, whose services
in suppressing the Khoja rebellion in 1847 are commemorated
in a tablet on one of the gates of Yarkand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_2_Page_8" id="Appendix_2_Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Although the period may be past in which a great
English Journal could ask, “<i>what</i> is Gilgit?” the contradictory
telegrams and newspaper accounts which we receive
regarding the countries adjoining Gilgit show that the
Press has still much to learn. Names of places, as far
apart as Edinburgh and London, are put within a day’s
march on foot. Names of men figure on maps as places
and the relationships of the Chiefs of the region in question
are invented or confounded as may suit the politics of the
moment, if not the capacity of the printer. The injunctions
of the Decalogue are applied or misapplied, extended or
curtailed, to suit immediate convenience, and a different
standard of morality is constantly being found for our
friends of to-day or our foes of to-morrow. The youth
Afzul-ul-Mulk was credited with all human virtues and
with even more than British manliness, as he was supposed
to be friendly to us. He had given his country into our
hands in order to receive our support against his elder
brother, the acknowledged heir of the late Aman-ul-Mulk
of Chitrál, but that elder brother, Nizám-ul-Mulk, was no
less friendly to English interests, although he has the
advantage of being a man of capacity and independence.
The sudden death of Aman-ul-Mulk coincided with the
presence of our protégé at Chitrál, and the first thing that
the virtuous Afzul-ul-Mulk did, was to invite as many
brothers as were within reach to a banquet when he
murdered them. No doubt, as a single-minded potentate,
he did not wish to be diverted from the task of governing
his country by the performance of social duties to
the large circle of acquaintances in brothers and their
families which Providence bestows on a native ruler or
claimant in Chitrál and Yasin. A member of the Khush-waqtia
dynasty of Yasin, which is a branch of the Chitrál
dynasty, told me when I expressed my astonishment at the
constant murders in his family: “A real relative in a high
family is a person whom God points out to one to kill as
an obstacle in one’s way, whereas a foster-relative (generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_2_Page_9" id="Appendix_2_Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of a lower class) is a true friend who rises and falls with
one’s own fortune” (it being the custom for a scion of
a noble house to be given out to a nurse.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The dynasty of Chitral is said to have been established
by Baba Ayub, an adventurer of Khorassan. He adopted
the already existing name of <i>Katór</i>, whence the dynasty
is called Katore. The Emperor Baber refers to the
country of Katór in his Memoirs and a still more ancient
origin has been found in identifying Katór with “Kitolo,
the King of the Great Yuechi, who, in the beginning of
the 5th century, conquered Balkh and Gandhara, and
whose son established the Kingdom of the Little Yuechi,
at Peshawur.” (See Biddulph’s “Tribes of the Hindoo
Koosh,” page 148.) General Cunningham asserts that the
King of Chitrál takes the title of Shah Kator, which has
been held for nearly 2,000 years, and the story of their
descent from Alexander may be traced to the fact that
they were the successors of the Indo-Grecian Kings in
the Kabul valley. If Katór is a corruption of Kaisar,
then let it not be said that the remnant of the Katore
exclaimed with the Roman gladiator: “Ave, Kaisar-i-Hind,
morituri te salutant.”</p>

<p>Amán-ul-Mulk, the late ruler of Chitrál, was, indeed, a
terrible man, who to extraordinary courage joined the arts
of the diplomatist. He succeeded his elder brother, surnamed
Adam-Khôr or “man-eater.” His younger brother,
Mir Afzul, is said to have been killed by him or to have
committed a convenient suicide; another brother, Sher
Afzul, who is now in possession of Chitrál, was long a
fugitive in Badakhshan whence he has just returned with
a few Afghans (such as any pretender can ever collect) and
a hundred of the Chitráli slaves that used to be given in
tribute to the Mir of Badakhshan, which itself never paid
a tribute to Kabul before the late Sher Ali of Afghanistan
installed Mahmud Shah, who expelled his predecessor
Jehandar Shah, the friend of Abdur-Rahman, the present
Amir of Afghanistan. Another brother of Aman-ul-Mulk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_2_Page_10" id="Appendix_2_Page_10">[10]</a></span>
was Kokhan Beg, whose daughter married the celebrated
Mullah Shahu Baba, a man of considerable influence in
Bajaur, who is feared by the Badshah of Kunar (a feudatory
of Kabul and a friend of the British) and is an enemy of
the Kamôji Kafirs, that infest one of the roads to Chitrál.
This Kokhan Beg, who was a maternal uncle of Afzul-ul-Mulk,
was killed the other day by his brother Sher Afzul
coming from Badakhshan. I mention all this, as in the
troubles that are preparing, the ramifications of the interests
of the various pretenders are a matter of importance. Other
brothers of Aman-ul-Mulk are: Muhammad Ali (Moriki),
Yádgar Beg, Shádman Beg and Bahádur Khán (all by a
mother of lower degree), and another Bahádur Khán, who
was on the Council of Nizám-ul-Mulk. Nizám-ul-Mulk has
therefore to contend with one or more of his uncles, and
by to-day’s telegram<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> is on his way to the Chitrál Fort in
order to expel Sher Afzul with the aid of the very troops
that Sher Afzul had sent to turn out Afzul-ul-Mulk’s
Governor from Yasin. I believe that Nizám-ul-Mulk has
or had two elder half-brothers, Gholam of Oyôn and Majid
Dastagir of Drôshp; but, in any case, he was the eldest
legitimate son and, according to Chitrál custom, was
invested with the title of Badshah of Turikoh, the rule of
which valley compelled his absence from Chitrál and not
“his wicked and intriguing disposition” as alleged by certain
Anglo-Indian journals. Of other brothers of Nizám-ul-Mulk
was Shah Mulk (of lower birth), who was Governor of
Daraung and was killed by Afzul-ul-Mulk. He used to live
at Dros (near Pathan in Shashi). Afzul-ul-Mulk of Drasun,
whom we have already mentioned as a wholesale fratricide,
was killed in his flight to one of the towers of the Chitrál
Fort from the invading force of his uncle, Sher Afzul of
Badakhshan. A younger half-brother is also Behram-ul-Mulk
(by a lower mother), called “Viláyeti,” of Moroi in
Andarti. Other brothers are: Amin-ul-Mulk, a brother of
good birth of Oyôn (Shoghôt), who was reared by a woman
of the Zondré or highest class; Wazir-ul-Mulk (of low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_2_Page_11" id="Appendix_2_Page_11">[11]</a></span>
birth) of Brôz; Abdur-Rahman (low-born) at Owir (Barpèsh),
and Badshah-i-Mulk, also of Owir, who was reared
by the wife of Fath-Ali Shah. There are no doubt other
brothers also whose names I do not know. Murid, who
was killed by Sher Afzul, is also an illegitimate brother.</p>

<p>A few words regarding the places mentioned in recent
telegrams may be interesting: Shogôth is the name of a
village, of a fort, and of a district which is the north-western
part of Chitrál, and it also comprises the Ludkho
and tributary valleys. Through the district is the road
leading to the Dara and Nuqsán passes, to the right and
left respectively, at the bottom of which is a lake on which
official toadyism has inflicted the name of Dufferin in supersession
of the local name. Darushp (Drôshp) is another big
village in this district and in the Ludkho valley, and Andarti
is a Fort in it within a mile of the Kafir frontier. The inhabitants
of Shogôth are descendants of Munjanis, whose
dialect (Yidgah) I refer to elsewhere, and chiefly profess to
be Shiahs, in consequence of which they have been largely
exported as slaves by their Sunni rulers. Baidam Khan, a
natural son of Aman-ul-Mulk, was the ruler of it. The
Ludkho valley is traversed by the Arkari river which falls
into that of Chitrál. At the head of the Arkari valley are
three passes over the Hindukhush, including the evil-omened
“Nuqsán,” which leads to Zeibak, the home of the
heretical Maulais (co-religionists of the Assassins of the
Crusades) in Badakhshán. It is shorter, more direct, and
freer from Kafir raids than the longer and easier Dora pass.
<i>Owir</i> is a village of 100 houses on the Arkari river, and is
about 36 miles from Zeibak. <i>Drasan</i> is both the name
of a large village and of a fort which commands the Turikoh
valley, a subdivision of the Drasan District, which is the
seat of the heir-apparent to the Chitrál throne (Nizám-ul-Mulk).
Yet the <i>Pioneer</i>, in its issue of the 5th October
last, considers that Lord Lansdowne had settled the question
of succession in favour of Afzul-ul-Mulk, that Nizám-ul-Mulk
would thus be driven to seek Russian aid, but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_2_Page_12" id="Appendix_2_Page_12">[12]</a></span>
any such aid would be an infringement of the rights of
Abdur-Rahman. Now that Abdur-Rahman is suspected,
on the flimsiest possible evidence, to have connived at Sher
Afzul’s invasion of Chitrál, we seek to pick a quarrel with
him for what a few weeks ago was considered an assertion
of his rights. Let it be repeated once for always that if ever
Abdur-Rahman or Nizám-ul-Mulk, or the Chief of Hunza
or Kashmir or Upper India fall into the arms of Russia, it
will be <i>maxima nostra culpa</i>. I know the Amir Abdur-Rahman,
as I knew the Amir Sher Ali, as I know Nizám-ul-Mulk,
and of all I can assert that no truer friends to England
existed in Asia than these Chiefs. Should Abdur-Rahman
be alienated, as Sher Ali was, or Nizám-ul-Mulk might be,
it will be entirely in consequence of our meddlesomeness
and our provocations. Russia has merely to start a will-o’-the-wisp
conversation between Grombcheffsky and the
Chief of Hunza, when there is internal evidence that
Grombcheffsky was never in Hunza at all, and certainly
never went there by the Muztagh Pass, that we, ignoring the
right of China and of the treaty with Kashmir in 1846,
forgetful of the danger in our rear and the undesirability
of paving for an invader the road in front, fasten a quarrel
on Hunza-Nagyr, and slaughter its inhabitants. No abuse
or misrepresentation was spared in order to inflame the
British public even against friendly and inoffensive Nagyr.
What wonder that a Deputation was sent from Hunza to
seek Russian aid and that it returned contented with presents,
and public expressions of sympathy which explained
away the Russian official refusal as softened by private
assurances of friendship? Whatever may be the disaster to
civilization in the ascendancy of Russian rule, the personal
behaviour of Russian agents in Central Asia is,
generally, pleasant. As in Hunza, so in Afghanistan, some
strange suspicion of the disloyalty of its Chief, suggested by
Russia, may involve us in a senseless war and inordinate
expense, with the eventual result that Afghanistan must be
divided between England and Russia, and their frontiers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_2_Page_13" id="Appendix_2_Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Asia become conterminous. Then will it be impossible for
England ever to oppose Russia in Europe, because fear of
complications in Asia will paralyze her. Then the tenure of
India will depend on concessions, for which that country is
not yet ripe, or on a reign of terror, either course ending in
the withdrawal of British administration from, at any rate,
Northern India. Yet it is “<i>Fas ab hosti doceri</i>,” and when
Prince Gortschakoff urged the establishment of a neutral
zone with autonomous states, including Badakhshan, he advocated
a policy that would have conducted to centuries of
peace and to the preservation of various ancient forms of
indigenous Oriental civilization by interposing the mysterious
blanks of the Pamirs and the inaccessible countries
of the Hindukush between Russian and British aggression.</p>

<p>If ever the pot called the kettle black, it is the story of
Anglo-Russian recriminations. Russian intrigues are ever
met by British manœuvres and Muscovite earth-hunger can
only be paralleled by English annexations. <i>Here</i> a tribe
is instigated to revolt, so that its extermination may “rectify

created by encroachments on the territories of feudatories
accused of disloyalty, if not of attempts to poison our

republics and monarchies, Anglo-Russian dominions are
becoming conterminous. Above all</p>

<p>And it is this unremitting suspicion which is alike the secret
of present success and the cause of eventual failure in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_2_Page_14" id="Appendix_2_Page_14">[14]</a></span>
wresting and keeping Asiatic countries and of the undying
hatred which injured natives feel towards Europeans.</p>

<p>The attempt to obtain the surrender of the Takk fort,
and of the Takk valley, a short and easy road to the
British District of Kaghán, has merely indicated to Russia
the nearest way to India, just as we forced her attention
to Hunza and are now drawing it to Chitrál. David
Urquhart used to accuse us of conspiracy with Russia in
foreign politics. Lord Dufferin in his Belfast speech sought
the safety of India in his friendship with M. de Giers and
his Secretary popularized Russia in India by getting his
work on “Russia” translated into Urdu. Certainly the
coincidence of Russian as well as British officials being
benefited by their respective encroachments, Commissions,
Delimitations, etc., would show their “mutual interest” to
consist in keeping up the farce of “Cox and Box” in
Central Asia, which must end in a tragedy.</p>

<p>As an official since 1855, when I served Her Majesty
during the Russian War, I wish to warn the British public
against the will-o’-the-wisp of our foreign policy, especially
in India. I can conceive that a small, moral and happy
people should seek the ascendancy of its principles, even if
accompanied by confusion in the camps of its enemies. I
can understand that the doctrines of Free Trade, of a free
Press, a Parliamentary rule, the Anti-Slavery propaganda
and philanthropic enterprises generally, with which the
British name is connected, should have been as good as an
army to us in every country of the world in which they
created a Liberal party, but these doctrines have often
weakened foreign Executive Governments, whilst “Free
Trade” ruined their native manufacture. What I, however,
cannot understand is that a swarming, starving and
unhappy population should seek consolation for misery at
home in Quixotism abroad, especially when that Quixotism
is played out. If bread costs as much now as in 1832
although the price of wheat has fallen from 60s. to 27s. a
quarter, it is, indeed, high time that we should lavish no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_2_Page_15" id="Appendix_2_Page_15">[15]</a></span>
more blood and treasure on the stones of foreign politics,
but that we should first extract the beam from our own eye
before we try to take out the mote from the eye of others.</p>

<p>What these foreign politics are worth may be inferred
from the growing distrust on the Continent of British
meddlesomeness or from what we should ourselves feel if
even so kindred a race as the Prussians sought to monopolize
British wealth and positions. It would be worse, if
they did so without possessing a thorough knowledge of
the English language or of British institutions. Yet we
are not filled with misgivings when our Indian Viceroys
or Secretaries of State cannot speak Hindustani, the <i>lingua
franca</i> of India or when an Under-Secretary has a difficulty
in finding Calcutta on the Map.</p>

<p>India should be governed in the fulness of knowledge
and sympathy, not by short cuts. It should not be the
preserve of a Class, but the <i>one</i> proud boast of its many and
varied peoples. When Her Majesty assumed Her Indian
title, it was by a mere accident, in which <i>pars magna fui</i>, at
the last moment, that the Proclamation was translated to
those whom it concerned at the Imperial Assemblage. This
superciliousness, wherever we can safely show it, the cynical
abandonment of our friends, the breach of pledges, the
constant experimentalizing on the natives, the mysteriousness
that conceals official ignorance, is the enemy to
British rule in India, not Russia. A powerful Empire can
afford to discard the arts of the weak, and <i>should</i> even
“show its hand.” India should be ruled by a permanent
Viceroy, a member of the Royal family, not by one whom
the exigencies of party can appoint and shift. When in
1869 the Chiefs and people of the Panjab deputed me to
submit their petition that H.R.H. the Prince of Wales
be pleased to visit India, it was because they felt that it was
desirable in the interests of loyalty to the Throne. If it
be true that H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught is going
out as the next Viceroy, I can only say that the longer his
admirers miss him in England, the better for India, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_2_Page_16" id="Appendix_2_Page_16">[16]</a></span>
requires its best interests to be grouped round a permanent
Chief.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Dec. 7th.</i>—As for the wanton aggression on Chilás which
never gave us the least trouble, as all our Deputy Commissioners
of Abbottabad can testify, it is a sequel of our interference
last year with Hunza-Nagyr. The Gilgit Residency
has disturbed a peace that has existed since 1856 and now
continues in its suicidal policy of indicating and paving the
nearest military road to British territory to an invader.
In November 1891 I wrote of the possibility of driving
even the peaceful, if puritanical, Chilásis into aggression
and now the <i>Times</i> telegraphs the cock-and-bull story of
the raft, enlarged in to-day’s <i>Times</i> telegram into an
attack of the Chilási tribesmen aided by those of Darêl
(another newly-created foe) on our convoy proceeding from
Bunji—the extreme frontier of Kashmir according to the
treaty of 1846—to Dr. Robertson’s Camp at (now) Talpenn
(spelt “Thalpin” in the telegram) and (then) Gôr, with, of
course, the inevitable result of the victory of the heroism
of rifles against a few old muskets and iron wrist-bands
(which the Chilásis use in fighting).</p>

<p>There are still other realms to conquer for our heroes.
There is the small Republic of Talitsha of 11 houses;
there is Chilás itself which admits women to the tribal
Councils and is thus in advance even of the India Office
and of the Supreme Council of the Government of India;
there is the Republic of Muhammadan learning, Kandiá,
that has not a single fort; there is, of course, pastoral
Dareyl; there are the Koli-Palus tribes, agricultural
Tangîr and other little Republics. Soon may we hear of
acts of “treachery,” “disloyalty,” etc. from Hôdur and Sazîn,
till we shoot down the supposed offenders with Gatlings and
destroy the survivors with our civilization. I humbly protest
against these tribes being sacrificed to a mistaken Russophobia.
I have some claim to be heard. I discovered
and named Dardistan and am a friend of its peoples.
Although my life was attempted more than once by agents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_2_Page_17" id="Appendix_2_Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of the Maharaja of Kashmir, I was the means of saving
that of his Commander-in-Chief, Zoraweru, when on his
Dareyl expedition. This is what the Gilgit Doctor did
in 1866 and what the Gilgit Doctor should do in 1892.
This is how friendship for the British name was, and should
be, cemented, and not by shedding innocent blood or by
acts worthy of <i>agents provocateurs</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As for the “<i>toujours perdrix</i>” of the Afghan advance
from Asmar (<i>Times</i>, December 8th) it is better than the
telegram in the <i>Standard</i> of the 2nd December 1892, in which
the Amir makes Sher Afzul Ruler of Kafiristan, a country
that has yet to be conquered, and which says “Consequently
there is now no buffer-state between Afghanistan and the
Pamirs”!! “Goods carried from India to Russian Turkestan,
through Chitral and <i>Kafiristan</i>, will pay <i>duty to the Amir</i>.”
Such journalistic forecasts and geography are inevitable when
full and faithful official information, such as it is, is, in a free
country, not obtainable by Parliament, the Press, and the
Public. Reuter’s Central Asian Telegrams, though meagre,
are more correct than those of certain correspondents of the
<i>Times</i> and <i>Standard</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Dec. 9th.</i>—Dr. Robertson has, at last, entered Chilás,
and found it deserted. <i>Solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.</i>
The <i>Times</i> Correspondent now admits that Chilás has
no connexion with Chitrál, but he still gives us “Tangail”
for “Tangir,” and omits the name of the member of the
ex-royal family of Yasin, who is supposed to have stirred up
against us the tribes of Darel and “Tangail,” among whom
he has resided for years. This is one of the Khushwaqtias,
though not the loyal chief to whom I have
referred, and who has rendered us good service. So we
have now an excuse for entering Tangir also. In the
meanwhile, the Russian <i>Svet</i> points out that the Russians
“would only have to march some 250 miles along a good
road to enter Cashmere,” “since it is impossible to invade
India viâ Afghanistan.” Yet are we nibbling at the Amir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_2_Page_18" id="Appendix_2_Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Abdurrahman, whose troops merely occupy the <i>status quo
ante</i> at Asmar, confronted by Umra Khan on the other side
of the Kuner river. We are forgetting the lessons of the
Afghan campaigns, and especially that, although Abdurrahman
allowed himself to be proclaimed by us, in his
absence, as Amir, he marched in at one side of Kabul,
whilst we marched out at the other. We forget that, with
the whole country against us in a revived Jehád, with the
discontent among our native troops and with a crushing expenditure,
we preferred a political fiasco in order to avoid a
still greater military fiasco. The Russians also urge “the
construction of a military road on their side from Marghelan
across the Pamirs” leaving us to finish it for them on
our side of the Hindukush. The pretension to Wakhan,
however, is already disposed of in Prince Gortchakoff’s
Convention with Lord Granville in 1872, and no notice
need be taken of the preposterous claim of the <i>Svet</i> to place
Chitrál under a Russian protectorate! Thus have we sown
the wind and reaped the whirlwind. Our real defence of India
lies, as Lord Lawrence ever held, in its good government,
and to this I would respectfully add, in justice to its Chiefs,
wherever they have a legitimate grievance. Mere speeches
of Viceroys, unaccompanied by acts, will not convince them
of our “good intentions.” It is also not by emasculating
the Dard tribes and breaking down their powers of resistance
to the level of Slaves to the British, that we can interpose
an effectual barrier to the invading Myriads of Slavs
that threaten the world’s freedom. By giving to the loyalty
of India the liberty which it deserves, on the indigenous
bases that it alone really understands and in accordance
with the requirements of the age, we can alone lead our
still martial Indian Millions in the defence of the Roman
Citizenship which should be the reward of their chivalrous
allegiance to the Queen.</p>

<p>My kind and true friend and dear companion, may you know:</p>

<p>That before this, prompted by excess of friendship and belief in me, you had written to
me a letter of sincerity full of pleasing precepts and words of faithfulness. These were
received and caused joy to my heart. My true friend, whatever words of faith and sincere
regard there were, these have been written in my mind. For I am one of your disciples
and well-wishers here, and have no other care but that of serving and well-wishing my
friends. My heart sorrows at separation from friends, but there is no remedy except
resignation. <i>As I consider your stay there [in London] as my own stay, I hope from your
friendship that you have expressed words of my well-being and my sincerity towards the
Lord Bahadoor and the Great Queen and thus performed the office of friendship and caused
joy there.</i> Another request is that if you have found a good dog like “Zulu,” when you
come to Delhi please send it to Jummoo. My men are there, and shall bring it to me.
Further, the volume of papers on the customs of Chitrár and the old folk-tales have been
written partly in Persian and partly in the Chitrári language. We are frontier and
village people, and are deficient in intelligence and eloquence. They have not been very
well done, and I don’t know if they will please you or not. But we have no better
eloquence or practice as we are hillmen.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The standard of affection and friendship, the foundation-stone of kindness and obligation,
my friend, may his kindness increase!</p>

<p>After expressing the desire of your joy-giving meeting be it known to your kind self,
that the condition of <i>this</i> your faithful friend is such as to call for thanks to the Almighty.
The safety and good health of <i>that</i> friend [yourself] is always wished for. As you had sent
me several volumes of bound papers to write on them the customs of the Chitrar people and
their folk-tales, partly in Persian and partly in Chitrari language, I have in accordance
with this request of <i>that</i> true friend got them written partly in Persian and partly in
Chitrari and sent to you. Inshallah, they will reach you, but I do not know whether
they will please you or not; in any case you know, that whatever may be possible to do
by a faithful friend or by his employés I will do, with the help of God, if you will forgive
any faulty execution of your wishes, and continue to remember me for any services in my
power, and keep me informed continually of your good health so as to dispel my anxiety.
The condition here is of all news the best, as no new event has happened; but three
persons, wayfarers and travellers, have come from Wakhan to Mastuch and two of these
persons I have sent on to Chitrar, and one of these wanderers has remained (behind)
at Mastuch. They don’t know anybody. Sometimes they say we are Russians,
and sometimes they say we are Frenchmen. And I with my own eye have not seen
them. If I had seen them, they might have told me. Another desire is that you
send me something worth reading in English words and write opposite to them their
translation into Persian, so that it may be a pleasure and useful to me. I have another
request to make which is that you may be pleased to give an early fulfilment to your
kind promise of visiting Chitrar with your lady for the purpose of sight-seeing and sport
and study. I have been waiting ever since for your arrival. It is really only right that
you should come now when the weather is very delightful, game is abundant, and I
have made every arrangement for our hunting together. Everything is tranquil and you
will be able to return before the winter, greatly pleased. Let this become a fact. The

<h5>1. <span class="smcap">The Vindictive Fowl.</span></h5>

<p>A fowl sat near a thistle, and opened a rag, in which
corals were tied up. Suddenly one fell into the thistle; the
fowl said, “O thistle, give me my coral.” The thistle said,
“This is not my business.” The fowl said, “Then I will
burn thee.” The thistle agreed. The fowl then begged the
fire to burn the thistle. The fire replied, “Why should I
burn this weak thorn?” The fowl thereupon threatened to
extinguish the fire by appealing to water: “O water, kill
this fire for my sake.” The water asked, “What is thy
enmity with the fire, that I should kill it?” The fowl said,
“I will bring a lean cow to drink thee up.” The water
said, “Well”; but the cow refused, as it was too lean and
weak to do so. Then the fowl threatened to bring the
wolf to eat the cow. The wolf refused, as he could feed
better on fat sheep. The fowl threatened the wolf with
the huntsman, as he would not eat the lean cow. The
huntsman refused to shoot the wolf, as it was not fit to eat.
The fowl then threatened the huntsman with the mouse.
The huntsman replied, “Most welcome.” But the mouse
said that it was feeding on almonds and other nice things,
and had no need to gnaw the leather-skin of the huntsman.
The fowl then said, “I will tell the cat to eat thee.”
The mouse said, “The cat is my enemy in any case, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_3_Page_2" id="Appendix_3_Page_2">[2]</a></span>
will try to catch and eat me, wherever it comes across me,
so what is the use of your telling the cat?” The fowl then
begged the cat to eat the mouse. The cat agreed to do so
whenever it was hungry: “Now,” it added, “I do not care
to do so.” The fowl then became very angry, and threatened
to bring little boys to worry the cat. The cat said, “Yes.”
The fowl then begged the little boys to snatch the cat one
from the other, so that it might know what it was to be
vexed. The boys, however, just then wanted to play and
fight among themselves, and did not care to interrupt their
own game. The fowl then threatened to get an old man to
beat the boys. The boys said, “By all means.” But the old
man refused to beat the boys without any cause, and called
the fowl a fool. The fowl then said to the Pîr (old man),
“I will tell the wind to carry away thy wool.” The old man
acquiesced; and the wind, when ordered by the fowl, with
its usual perverseness, obeyed the fowl, and carried off the
old man’s wool. Then the old man beat the boys, and the
boys worried the cat, and the cat ran after the mouse, and
the mouse bit the huntsman in the waist, and the huntsman
went after the wolf, and the wolf bit the cow, and the cow
drank the water, and the water came down on the fire, and
the fire burnt the thistle, and the thistle gave the coral to
the fowl, and the fowl took back its coral.</p>

<h5>2. <span class="smcap">The Story of the Golden Mouse who tells the
Story of a Mouse and a Frog.</span></h5>

<p>There was a kind of mice that had a golden body.
They never went out of their hole. One day one of them
thought: “I will go out and see the wonders of God’s creation.”
So it did; and when thirty or forty yards from its
hole, a cat, prowling for game, saw it come out from the
hole. The cat, that was full of wiles, plotted to get near
the hole, awaiting the return of the mouse, who, after its
peregrinations, noticed the mouth of the hole closed by
the wicked cat. The mouse then wished to go another
way, and turned to the left, towards a tree, on which sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_3_Page_3" id="Appendix_3_Page_3">[3]</a></span>
concealed a crow, expecting to devour the mouse when it
should run away from the cat. The crow then pounced on
the mouse, who cried out to God, “O God, why have
these misfortunes overtaken such a small being as myself?
My only help is in thee, to save me from these calamities.”
The mouse was confused, and ran hither and thither, in
vain seeking a refuge, when it saw another cat stealthily
approaching it; and, in its perplexity, the mouse nearly ran
into the cat’s paws; but that cat had been caught in a
hunter’s net, and could do nothing. The crow, and the cat
which was watching at the hole, saw that the mouse had
got near another cat between the two. They thought that
the mouse had fallen a victim to the second cat, and that
it was no use remaining. It was the fortune of the mouse
that they should be so deceived. The trembling mouse
saw that the two enemies had gone. It thanked the
Creator for having escaped from the cat and the crow, and it
said, “It would be most unmanly of me not to deliver the
cat in the net, as it has been the instrument of my safety;
but then, if I set it free, it will eat me.” The mouse was
immersed in thought, and came to the conclusion to gnaw
the net at a distance from the cat, and that as soon as the
hunter should come in sight, the cat then, being afraid of
the hunter, would seek its own safety, and not trouble
itself about the mouse. “Thus I will free the cat from the
hunter and the net, and deliver my own life from the cat,”
was the thought of the mouse. It then began to gnaw
the net at a distance. The cat then said to the mouse, “If
you want to save me, for God’s sake, then gnaw the net
round my throat, and not at a distance; that is no use to
me when the hunter will come. You err if you think that
I will eat you as soon as I get out. For all the faults,
hitherto, have been on the side of cats, which you mice
have never injured, so that, if you are magnanimous and
release me, there is no such ungrateful monster in the
world as would return evil for the unmerited good that I
implore you to bestow on me.” The golden mouse, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_3_Page_4" id="Appendix_3_Page_4">[4]</a></span>
was very wise, did not attend to this false speech, but continued
to gnaw the net at a distance, so that, when the
hunter came, there only remained the threads round the
neck of the cat, which the mouse bit asunder at the last
moment and then ran back into its hole. The cat bolted
up the tree where the crow had sat, the huntsman saw that
the cat had escaped, and that his net was gnawed in several
places, so he took the net to get it repaired in the Bazaar.</p>

<p>Then the cat descended from the tree and said to herself,
“The time of meals is over, it is no use to go home;
I had better make friends with the mouse, entice it out of
the hole, and eat it.” This she did, and going to the hole,
called out: “O faithful companion and sympathizing friend,
although there has been enmity between cats and mice for a
long time, thou hast, by God’s order, been the cause of my
release, therefore come out of the hole, and let us lay the
foundation of our friendship.” The mouse replied: “I
once tried to come out, and then I fell from one danger into
another. Now it is difficult for me to comply with your
request. I have cut the threads encircling your throat, not
out of friendship for you, but out of gratitude to God. Nor
is our friendship of any use in this world, as you will gather
from the story of</p>

<h5>3. “<span class="smcap">The Frog and the Mouse.</span>”</h5>

<p>The mouse then narrated: “There was once a mouse
that went out for a promenade, and going into people’s
houses, found food here and there, and in the dawn of
the next morning it was returning to its home. It came
to a place where there was a large tank, round which
there were flowers and trees; and a voice was heard
from out of the tank. Coming near, it saw that it
emanated from a being that had no hair on its body,
no tail, and no ear. The mouse said to itself: ‘What is
this ill-formed being?’ and thanked God that it was not
the ugliest of creatures. With this thought the mouse, that
was standing still, shook its head to and fro. The frog,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_3_Page_5" id="Appendix_3_Page_5">[5]</a></span>
however, thought that the mouse was smitten with astonishment
at his beauty and entranced with pleasure at his voice,
and jumping out of the corner of the tank came near: ‘I
know, beloved, that you are standing charmed with my
voice; we ought to lay the firm basis of our friendship,
but you are sharper than I am, therefore go to the house
of an old woman and steal from it a thread, and bring it
here.’ The mouse obeyed the order. The frog then said:
‘Now tie one end to your tail and I will tie the other end
to my leg, because I want to go to your house, where you
have a large family and there are many other mice, so that
I may know you from the others. If again you visit me,
the tank is large, my friends many, and you too ought to
distinguish me from the rest. Again, when I want to see
you I will follow the thread to your hole, and when you
want to see me you will follow it to the tank.’ This being
settled, they parted. One day the frog wanted to see the
mouse. Coming out of the tank he was going to its hole,
when he saw the mouse-hawk, who pounced upon the frog
as he was limping along, and flew up with him in its
claws. This pulled the end to which the mouse was tied.
It thought that its lover had come to the place and
wanted to see it; so it came out, only to be dragged
along in the air under the mouse-hawk. As the unfortunate
mouse passed a Bazaar it called out: ‘O ye Mussulmans,
learn from my fate what happens to whoever befriends
beings of a different species.’</p>

<p>“Now,” said the golden mouse to the cat, “this is the
story which teaches me what to do; and that is, to decline
your friendship and to try never again to see your face.”</p>

<h5>4. <span class="smcap">The Quail and the Fox.</span></h5>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The Quail said: I teach thee art.</div>
<div class="verse">Night and day I work at art;</div>
<div class="verse">Whoever lies, the shame is on his neck.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A quail and a fox were friends. The fox said: “Why
should you not make me laugh some day?” The quail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_3_Page_6" id="Appendix_3_Page_6">[6]</a></span>
replied, “This is easy.” So they went to a Bazaar, where the
quail, looking through the hole in the wall of a house, saw
a man sitting, and his wife turning up and down the
“samanak” sweetmeat with a big wooden ladle (much in
the same way as the Turkish <i>rakat lokum</i>, or lumps of
delight, are made). The quail then settled on the head
of the man. The woman said to him, “Don’t stir; I will
catch it.” Then the quail sat on the woman’s head, so
the man asked the woman to be quiet, as he would catch
the quail, which, however, then flew back to the head of
the man. This annoyed the wife, who struck at the quail
with the wooden ladle, but hit instead the face of her husband,
whose eye and beard were covered with the sweetmeat,
and who thereupon beat his wife. When the fox
saw this, he rejoiced and laughed greatly; and both the
fox and quail returned to their home. After a time the
fox said to the quail: “It is true that you have made me
laugh, but could you feed me?” This the quail undertook
to do, and with the fox went to a place where a woman was
carrying a plate of loaves of bread to her husband in the
fields. Then the quail repeated her tactics, and sat on the
head of the woman, who tried to catch it with one hand.
The quail escaped and settled on one shoulder, then on
another, and so on till the woman became enraged, put the
plate of bread on the ground, and ran after the quail, who,
by little leaps, attracted her further and further away till
she was at a considerable distance from it, when the fox
pounced on the bread and appeased his hunger.</p>

<p>Some time after, the fox wanted to put the cleverness of
the quail again to the test, and said: “You have made me
laugh, you have fed me, now make me weep.” The quail
replied, “Why, this is the easiest task of all,” so she took
the fox to the gate of the town and called out: “O ye
dogs of the Bazaar, come ye as many as ye are, for a fox
has come to the gate!” So all the dogs, hearing this good
news, assembled to hunt the fox, which, seeing the multitude
of its enemies, fled till he reached a high place. Turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_3_Page_7" id="Appendix_3_Page_7">[7]</a></span>
round, he saw the dogs following, so he jumped down
and broke his back. The fox therefore helplessly sat down
and said to the approaching quail: “O sympathizing
companion, see how my mouth has become filled with mud
and blood, and how my back has been broken. This is
my fate in this world; now, could you kindly clean my
mouth from mud and blood, as my end is near?” The
intention of the fox was, that he should take the opportunity
of this artifice to swallow the quail in revenge of her being
the cause of its death. The quail, in her unwise friendship,
began to clean the fox’s mouth. The accursed fox caught
her in his mouth; but the quail, which was intelligent and
clever, said, “O beloved friend, your eating me is lawful,
because I forgive you my blood, on condition that you
pronounce my name, otherwise you will suffer an injury.”
The base fox, although full of wiles, clouded by approaching
death, fell into the trap, and as soon as he said “O quail,”
his teeth separated, and the quail flew away from him and
was safe, whilst the fox died.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">II. Stories and Legends.</span></h4>

<p>There is a story which seems to illustrate the fact that
private hatred is often the cause of the injury that is
ascribed to accident. A man slaughtered a goat, and kept
it over-night in an outhouse. His enemy put a number of
cats through the airhole, and when their noise awoke the
master of the house he only found the bones of his goat.
But he took their bones, and scattered them over the field
of his enemy the same night; and the dogs came, smelling
the bones, searched for them, and destroyed the wheat that
was ripe for reaping. One blamed the cats, the other
blamed the dogs; but both had the reward of their own
actions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sulei was a man well known on the frontier of Chitrál
for his eloquence. One day, as he was travelling, he
met a man from Badakhshan, who asked him whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_3_Page_8" id="Appendix_3_Page_8">[8]</a></span>
he knew Persian. Sulei said, “No.” “Then,” replied the
Badakhshi, “you are lost” [nobody, worthless]. Sulei at
once rejoined, “Do you know Khowár?” (the language of
Chitrál). “No,” said the Badakhshi. “Then you too are
lost,” wittily concluded Sulei (to show that personal worth
or eloquence does not depend on knowing any particular
language).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is related that beyond Upper Chitrár there is a country
called <i>Shin</i> or Rashan. It is very beautiful, and its plains
are gardens, and its trees bear much fruit, and its chunars
(plane trees) and willows make it a shaded land. Its earth
is red, and its water is white and tasty. They say that in
ancient times the river of that district for a time flowed
with milk without the dashing (of the waves) of water.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Besir is a place near Ayin towards Kafiristan. The
inhabitants were formerly savage Kafirs, but are now subjects
of the Mehter (Prince) of Chitrár. They carry loads
of wood, and do not neglect the work of the Mehter. They
are numerous and peaceful, and in helplessness like fowls,
but they are still Kafirs; though in consequence of their
want of energy and courage they are called “Kalàsh.”
The people of Ayin say that in ancient times five savages
fled into the Shidi Mount and concealed themselves there.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Shidi is below Ayin opposite Gherát on the east
(whence Shidi is on the west). Between them is a river.
It is said that these savages had to get their food by the
chase. One day word came to them from God that “to-day
three troops of deer will pass; don’t interfere with the
first, but do so with the others.” When, however, the
troops came, the savages forgot the injunctions of God, and
struck the first deer. Now there was a cavern in the
mountain where they lived, into which they took the two or
three deer that they had killed and were preparing to cook,
two being sent out to fetch water. By God’s order the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_3_Page_9" id="Appendix_3_Page_9">[9]</a></span>
lips of the cavern were closed, and the three men imprisoned
in it. God converted the three into bees, whilst
the two who had gone to fetch water fled towards Afghanistan.
Thus were created the first honey-bees, who, finding
their way out of the cavern, spread themselves and their
sweet gift all over the world. This is a story told by the
Kalàsh, who credit that the bees are there still; but it is
difficult to get there, as the mountains are too steep, but
people go near it and, pushing long rods into the hole of
the cavern, bring them back covered with honey.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Shah Muhterim is the name of a Mehter (prince), the
grandfather of the present Ruler of Chitrár. This Mehter
was renowned as a descendant of fairies, who all were
under his command. Whatever he ordered the fairies did.
Thus some time passed. From among them he married
a fairy, with whom he made many excursions. She bore
him a daughter. Seven generations have passed since
that time. This daughter is still alive, and her sign
among the fairies is that her hair is white, which does not
happen to ordinary fairies. Whenever a descendant of the
Shah Muhterim leaves this transitory world for the region
of permanence, all the fairies, who reside in the mountains
of Chitrár, together with that white-haired lady, weep and
lament, and their voices are clearly heard. This statement
is sure and true, and all the men on the frontiers of
Chitrár are aware of the above fact.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The People of Aujer (the Bœotia of Chitral).</span></h5>

<p>There is a country “Aujer,” on the frontier of Chitrár
(or Chitrāl as we call it), the inhabitants of which in ancient
times were renowned for their stupidity. One had taken
service at Chitrár, and at a certain public dinner noticed
that the King (Padishah) ate nothing. So he thought that
it was because the others had not given anything to the
king. This made him very sorry. He left the assembly,
and reached home towards evening; there he prepared a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_3_Page_10" id="Appendix_3_Page_10">[10]</a></span>
great amount of bread, and brought it next day to the
council enclosure, beckoning to the king with his finger to
come secretly to him. The king could not make this out,
and sent a servant to inquire what was the matter; but the
man would not say anything except that the king should
come himself. On this the king sent his confidant to find
out what all this meant. The man answered the inquiries
of the confidant by declaring that he had no news or
claim, but “as they all ate yesterday and gave nothing to
the king, my heart has become burnt, and I have cooked
all this bread for him.” The messenger returned and
told the king, who told the meeting, causing them all to
laugh. The king, too, smiled, and said: “As this poor
man has felt for my need, I feel for his;” and ordered the
treasurer to open for him the door of the treasury, so
that he might take from it what he liked. The treasurer
took him to the gate, next to which was the treasurer’s
own house, where he had put a big water-melon, on which
fell the eye of that stupid man from Aujer. He had
never seen such a thing, and when he asked, “What is
it?” the treasurer, knowing what a fool he had to deal
with, said, “This is the egg of a donkey.” Then he
showed him the gold, silver, jewels, precious cloths, and
clean habiliments of the treasury from which to select the
king’s present. The man was pleased with nothing, and
said, “I do not want this; but, if you please, give me the
egg of the donkey, then I shall indeed be glad.” The
treasurer and the king’s confidant, consulting together,
came to the conclusion that this would amuse the king to
hear, and gave him the melon, with the injunction not to
return to the king, but to take the egg to his house, and
come after some nights (days). The fool was charmed
with this request, went towards his home, but climbing a
height, the melon fell out of his hand, rolled down towards
a tree and broke in two pieces. Now there was a hare
under that tree, which fled as the melon touched the tree.
The fool went to his house full of grief, said nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_3_Page_11" id="Appendix_3_Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to his wife and children, but sat mournfully in a corner.
The wife said, “O man, why art thou sorry? and what
has happened?” The man replied: “Why do you ask?
there is no necessity.” Finally, on the woman much cajoling
him, he said: “From the treasury of the prince (mehter) I
had brought the egg of the donkey; it fell from me on the
road, broke, and the young one fled out from its midst.
I tried my utmost, but could not catch it.” The woman
said: “You silly fellow! had you brought it, we might
have put loads on it.” The man replied, “You flighty
thing! how could it do so, when it was still so young?
Why, its back would have been broken.” So he got into
a great rage, took his axe, and cut down his wife, who died
on the spot.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Once, a donkey having four feet, in this country of donkeys
having two feet, put his head into a jar of jáo (barley),
but could not extricate it again. So the villagers assembled,
but could not hit on a plan to effect this result. But
there was a wise man in that land, and he was sent for and
came. He examined all the circumstances of the case, and
finally decided that they should do him “Bismillah”; that
is to say, that they should cut his throat with the formula,
“in the name of God,” which makes such an act lawful.
When they had done this to the poor donkey, the head remained
in the jar, and the wise man ordered them now to
break the jar. This they did, and brought out the head
of the donkey. The wise man then said: “If I had not
been here, in what manner could you have been delivered
of this difficulty?” This view was approved by all, even
by the owner of the donkey.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two brothers in that country of idiots, being tired of
buying salt every day, decided on sowing it over their
fields, so that it may bring forth salt abundantly. The
grass grew up, and the grasshoppers came; and the
brothers, fearing that their crop of salt would be destroyed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_3_Page_12" id="Appendix_3_Page_12">[12]</a></span>
armed themselves with bows and arrows to kill the grasshoppers.
But the grasshoppers jumped hither and thither,
and were difficult to kill; and one of the brothers hit the
other by mistake with an arrow instead of a grasshopper,
and he got angry, and shot back and killed his brother.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A penknife once fell into the hands of this people, so
they held a council in order to consider what it was. Some
thought it was the young one of a sword, the others that it
was the baby of an axe, but that its teeth had not yet come
out. So the argument waxing hot, they fell to fight one
another, and many were wounded and killed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A number of these people, considering that it was not
proper that birds alone should fly, and that they were able
to do so, clad themselves in posteens (some of which are
made from the light down of the Hindukush eagle), and
threw themselves down from a great height, with the result
that they reached the ground killed and mangled.</p>

<p>The following is an attempt to render the pretty tune
of a more worldly Laila and Majnûn song, which reminds
one of the “Yodeln” of the Tyrolese. It was sung to me
by Taighûn Shah, the poet-minstrel of the Raja, to the
accompaniment of a kind of guitar. The Chitráli language,
it will be perceived, is musical.</p>

<p>The accompanying illustration was autotyped some years ago from a photograph taken in
1881, and is now published for the first time. Following the numbers on each figure
represented we come first to No. 1, the tall Khudayár, the son of an Akhun or Shiah
priest of Nagyr, a country ruled by the old and wise Tham or Raja Zafar Ali Khan,
whose two sons, Alidád Khan in 1866, and Habib ulla Khan in 1886, instructed me in the
Khajuná language, which is spoken alike in gentle but brave Nagyr and in its hereditary
rival country, the impious and savage Hunza “Hun-land,” represented by figure 6, Matavalli,
the ex-kidnapper whom I took to England, trained to some Muhammadan piety,
and sent to Kerbelá a year ago. No. 2 was an excellent man, an Uzbek visitor from Koláb,
one Najmuddin, a poet and theologian, who gave me an account of his country. Nos. 3
and 4 are pilgrims from Nagyr to the distant Shiah shrine in Syria of the martyrdom of
Husain at Kerbelá; No. 5 is a Chitráli soldier, whilst No. 7 is a distinguished Arabic
Scholar from Gabriál, from whom much of my information was derived regarding a peaceful
and learned home, now, alas! threatened by European approach, which my travels in 1866
and 1872, and my sympathetic intercourse with the tribes of the Hindu Kush, have unfortunately
facilitated. The Jalkóti, Dareyli, and others, who are referred to in the course
of the present narrative, will either figure on other illustrations or must be “taken as
read.” No. 8 is the Sunni Moulvi Habibulla, a Tájik of Bukhara and a Hakîm (physician).
No. 9 is my old retainer, Ghulám Muhammad, a Shiah of Gilgit, a Shîn Dard
(highest caste), who was prevented by me from cutting down his mother, which he was
attempting to do in order “to save her the pain of parting from him.” 10. Ibrahim
Khan, a Shiah, Rôno (highest official caste) of <i>Nagyr</i>, pilgrim to Kerbelá. 11. Sultan Ali
Yashkun (2nd Shîn caste) Shiah, of Nagyr, pilgrim to Kerbelá. The word “Yashkun”
is, perhaps, connected with “Yuechi.”</p>

<p>The languages spoken by these men are: Khajuná by the Hunza-Nagyr men; Arnyiá
by the Chitráli; Turki by the Uzbek from Koláb; Shiná by the Gilgiti; Pakhtu and
Shuthun, a dialect of Shiná, by the Gabriáli. The people of <i>Hunza</i> are dreaded robbers
and kidnappers; they, together with the people of Nagyr, speak a language, Khajuná,
which philologists have not yet been able to classify, but which I believe to be a remnant
of a pre-historic language. They are great wine-drinkers and most licentious. They are
nominally Muláis, a heresy within the Shiah schism from the orthodox Sunni Muhammadan
faith, but they really only worship their Chief or Raja, commonly called “Thàm.”
The present ruler’s name is Mohammad Khan. They are at constant feud with the
people of <i>Nagyr</i>, who have some civilization, and are <i>now</i> devoted Shiahs (whence the number
of pilgrims, four, from one village). They are generally fair, and taller than the people
of Hunza, who are described as dark skeletons. The Nagyris have fine embroideries, and
are said to be accomplished musicians. Their forts confront those of Hunza on the other
side of the same river. The people of <i>Badakhshán</i> used to deal largely in kidnapped
slaves. A refugee, Shahzada Hasan, from the former royal line (which claims descent
from Alexander the Great), who has been turned out by the Afghan faction, was then at Gilgit
with a number of retainers on fine Badakhshi horses, awaiting the fortunes of war,
or, perhaps, the support of the British. He was a younger brother of Jehandár Shah, who
used to infest the Koláb road, after being turned out by a relative, Mahmûd Shah, with the
help of the Amir of Kabul. <i>Koláb</i> is about eleven marches from <i>Faizabád</i>, the capital
of Badakhshán. The Chitráli is from Shogòt, the residence of Adam Khor (man-eater),
brother of Aman-ul-Mulk, of Chitrál, who used to sell his Shiah subjects regularly into
slavery and to kidnap Bashgeli Kafirs. The man from <i>Gabriál</i> was attracted to Lahore by
the fame of the Oriental College, Lahore, as were also several others in this group; and
there can be no doubt that this institution may still serve as a nucleus for sending pioneers
of our civilization throughout Central Asia. Gabriál is a town in Kandiá, or Kiliá,
which is a secluded Dard country, keeping itself aloof from tribal wars. <i>Gilgit</i> and its
representative have been described in my “Dardistan,” to which refer, published in
parts between 1866 and 1877.</p>

<h4>I. POLO IN HUNZA-NAGYR.</h4>

<p>Although our first practical knowledge of “Polo” was derived from the
Manipuri game as played at Calcutta, it is not Manipur, but Hunza and
Nagyr, that maintain the original rules of the ancient “Chaughán-bazi,”
so famous in Persian history. The account given by J. Moray Brown
for the “Badminton Library” of the introduction of Polo into England
(Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1891), seems to me to be at variance with the
facts within my knowledge, for it was introduced into England in 1867, not
1869, by one who had played the Tibetan game as brought to Lahore by
me in 1866, after a tour in Middle and Little Tibet. Since then it has
become acclimatized not only in England, but also in Europe. The
Tibet game, however, does not reach the perfection of the Nagyr game,
although it seems to be superior to that of Manipur. Nor is Polo the only
game in Hunza-Nagyr. “Shooting whilst galloping” at a gourd filled
with ashes over a wooden scaffold rivals the wonderful performances of
“archery on horseback,” in which the people of Hunza and Nagyr (not
“Nagar,” or the common Hindi word for “town,” as the telegram has it) are
so proficient. Nor are European accompaniments wanting to these Central
Asian games; for prizes are awarded, people bet freely in Hunza as they
do here, they drink as freely, listen to music, and witness the dancing of
lady charmers, the Dayál, who, in Hunza, are supposed to be sorceresses,
without whom great festivities lose their main attraction. The people are
such keen sportsmen that it is not uncommon for the Tham, or ruler, to
confiscate the house of the unskilful hunter who has allowed a Markhôr
(Ibex) that he might have shot to escape him. Indeed, this even happens
when a number of Markhôrs are shut up in an enclosure, “<i>tsá</i>,” as a preserve
for hunting. The following literally translated dialogue regarding
Polo and its rules tells an attentive reader more “between the lines” than
pages of instructions:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Poló</span> = Bolá.—The Raja has ordered many people: To-morrow Polo I will play. To
the musicians give notice they will play.</p>

<p>Hast thou given notice, O (thou)?</p>

<p>Yes, I have given notice, O Nazúr; let me be thy offering (sacrifice).</p>

<p>Well, we will come out, that otherwise it will become (too) hot.</p>

<p>The Raja has gone out for Polo; go ye, O (ye); the riders will start.</p>

<p>Now divided will be, O ye! (2) goals nine nine (games) we will do (play). Tola-half
(= 4 Rupees) a big sheep bet we will do.</p>

<p>Now bet we have made. To the Raja the <i>ball</i> give, O ye, <i>striking</i> (whilst galloping)
he will take.</p>

<p>O ye, efforts (search) make, young men, to a man disgrace is death; you your own
<i>party</i> abandon not; The Raja has taken the <i>ball to strike</i>; play up, O ye musicians!</p>

<p>Now descend (from your horses) O ye; Tham has come out (victorious); now again
the day after to-morrow, he (from fatigue) <i>recovering Poló</i> we will strike (play).</p>

<p><i>Rules</i>:—The musical instruments of Polo; the ground for the game; the riders; the
goals; 9, 9 games let be (nine games won); the riders nine one side; nine one (the
other) side; when this has become (the case) the drum (Tsagàr) they will strike.</p>

<p>First the Tham takes the ball (out into the Maidan to strike whilst galloping at
full speed).</p>

<p>The Tham’s <i>side</i> upper part will take.</p>

<p>The rest will strike from the lower part (of the ground).</p>

<p>Those above the goal when becoming will take to the lower part.</p>

<p>Those below the goal when becoming to above taking the ball will send it flying.</p>

<p>Thus being (or becoming) whose goal when becoming, the ball will be sent flying and
the musicians will play.</p>

<p>Whose nine goals when has become, they issue (victorious).</p>

<h4>II. THE KOHISTÁN OF THE INDUS, INCLUDING GABRIÁL.</h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Account of Mir Abdulla.</span></h5>

<p>The real native place of Mir Abdulla is in the territory of Nandiyar; but
his uncle migrated to, and settled in, Gabriál. The Mir narrates:—</p>

<p>“In the country of Kunar there is a place called <i>Pusht</i>, where lives a
Mulla who is famous for his learning and sanctity. I lived for a long
time as his pupil, studying Logic, Philosophy, and Muhammadan Law, the
subjects in which the Mulla was particularly proficient. When my absence
from my native place became too long, I received several letters and messages
from my parents, asking me to give up my studies and return
home. At last I acceded to their pressing demands and came to my native
village. There I stayed for a long time with my parents; but as I was
always desirous to pursue my studies, I was meditating on my return to
Pusht, or to go down to India.</p>

<p>In the meantime I met one Abdulquddūs of Kohistan, who was returning
from India. He told me that a Dár-ul-u’lûm (House of Sciences) had been
opened at Lahore, the capital of the Punjab, where every branch of learning
was taught, and that it was superintended by Dr. L., who being himself a
proficient scholar of Arabic and Persian, was a patron of learning and a
warm supporter of students from foreign countries. I was accompanied
by two pupils of mine, named Sher Muhammad and Burhánuddin;
and I started together with them from my native village. We passed
through the territory of <i>Dir</i>, which is governed by Nawab Rahmatulla
Khan. The Qazi of that place was an old acquaintance of mine, and he
persuaded me to stop my journey, and promised to introduce me to the
Nawab, and procure for me a lucrative and honourable post. I declined
his offer, and continued my journey. The next territory we entered in
was that of Nawab <i>Tore Mian Khan</i>, who reigns over eight or nine
hundred people. After staying there some days we reached <i>Kanan
Gharin</i>, which was governed jointly by Nawabs Fazl Ahmad and Bayazid
Khan. After two days’ march we came to <i>Chakesur</i>, which was under a
petty chief named Suhe Khan. Here we were told that there are two
roads to India from this place—one, which is the shorter, is infested
with robbers; and the other, the longer one, is safe; but we were too
impatient to waste our time, and decided at once to go by the shorter
way, and proceeded on our journey. We met, as we were told, two
robbers on the road, who insisted on our surrendering to them all our
baggage. But we made up our minds to make a stand, though we were
very imperfectly armed, having only one “tamancha” among three
persons. In the conflict which ensued, one of the robbers fell, and the
other escaped; but Burhanuddin, one of our party, was also severely
wounded, and we passed the night on the banks of a neighbouring stream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_4_Page_4" id="Appendix_4_Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and reached next day <i>Ganagar Sirkol Jatkol</i>, where we halted for eight
or nine days. In this place the sun is seen only three or four times a
year, when all the dogs of the village, thinking him an intruding stranger,
begin to bark at him. Burhanuddin, having recovered there, went back
to his home, and I, with the other companion, proceeded to the Punjab,
and passing through the territory of a chief, named <i>Shálkhan</i>, entered
the British dominions. On arriving at Lahore we were told that Dr.
L. was not there, and my companion, too impatient to wait, went down
to Rampur, and I stayed at Lahore.” He then gave an account of—</p>

<h5>THE KOHISTÁN (OR MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY).<br />
(<span class="smcap">A Different Country from one of the Same Name near Kabul.</span>)</h5>

<p><i>Boundaries.</i>—It is bounded on the north by <i>Chitrál</i>, <i>Yasin</i>, and <i>Hunza</i>,
on the east by <i>Chilas</i>, <i>Kashmir</i>, and a part of <i>Hazara</i>; on the south by
<i>Yaghistán</i> (or wild country); on the west by <i>Swat</i> and <i>Yaghistán</i>.</p>

<p>It is surrounded by three mountainous ranges running parallel to each
other, dividing the country into two parts (the northern part is called
<i>Gabriál</i>). The Indus flows down through the country, and has a very
narrow bed here, which is hemmed in by the mountains.</p>

<p>The northern part, which is called Gabriál, has only two remarkable
villages—<i>Kandyá</i>, on the western side of the river, and <i>Siwa</i> on the
eastern; and the southern part contains many towns and villages:—</p>

<p>That part of <i>Yaghistán</i> which bounds Kohistan on the west is divided
into (1) <i>Thakot</i>, which is governed by Shalkhán, and (2) <i>Dishán</i>, which is
under Ram Khan; and that part of Yaghistán which bounds it on the south
is divided into three valleys,—</p>

<p>Between the southern part of Kohistan and Alahi, in the eastern corner,
there is a plain, of a circular form, surrounded on all sides by mountains.
This plain is always covered with grass, and streams of clear
and fresh water run through it. Both the grass and the water of this vast
meadow are remarkable for their nourishing and digestive qualities. This
plain is called “<i>Chaur</i>,” and is debatable ground between the Kohistanis
of Ladai, Kolai, and Palas, and the Afghans of Alahi.</p>

<p><i>People.</i>—The people of this country are not allied to the Afghans, as
their language shows, but have the same erect bearing and beautiful features.</p>

<p><i>Language.</i>—Their language is altogether different from that of their
neighbours, the Afghans, as will be shown by the following comparison:—</p>

<p>There is a song very current in Kohistan which begins,—</p>

<p><i>Palas kulal mariga, Patane jirga hotiga, Johle johal madado propár asáli</i> =
“In Palas a potter was killed, in Patan the jirga (or tribal assembly) sat.”</p>

<p>“The corrupted (Jirga of Malaks) took a bribe, and retaliation was
ignored.” The Afghans are called Pathans.</p>

<p><i>Religion.</i>—They have been converted to Islám since four or five generations,
and they have forsaken their old religion so completely that no
tinge of it now remains; and when a Kohistani is told that they are “nau-Muslims,”
that is, “new Muhammadans,” he becomes angry.</p>

<p>Muslim learning, and the building of mosques have become common in
Kohistan, and now we find twenty or thirty learned mullas in every considerable
town, besides hundreds of students, studying in mosques.</p>

<p><i>Dress.</i>—Their national dress consists of a woollen hat, brimmed like
that of Europeans, and a loose woollen tunic having a long ‎‏ جاكى‏‎ along the
right breast, so that one can easily get out the right hand to wield one’s
arms in a fight. Their trousers are also made of wool and are very tight.
In the summer they wear a kind of leathern shoes borrowed from the
Afghans, but in the winter they wear a kind of boots made of grass (the
straw of rice) reaching to the knees. They call it “pájola.”</p>

<p>Till very lately their only arms were a small “khanjar” (dagger),
bows and arrows; but they have borrowed the use of guns and long swords
from the Afghans.</p>

<p>The dress of their women consists of a loose woollen head-dress with
silken fringes, a woollen tunic and blue or black trousers of cotton cloth,
which they call “<i>shakara</i>.” Generally their women work with their husbands
in the corn-fields, and do not live confined to their houses.</p>

<p><i>Government.</i>—They have no chiefs like the Afghans, but influential
Malaks lead them to battle, who are paid no tribute, salary, etc.</p>

<p>When an enemy enters their country they whistle so sharply that the
sound is heard for miles; then the whole tribe assembles in one place for
the defence of their country, with their respective Malaks at their heads.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Living, and other Social Customs.</i>—In winter they live in the valleys,
in houses made of wood and stones; but in summer they leave their
houses in the valleys for those on the peaks of mountains, and the mass
of the population spends the summer in the cooler region; but those who
cultivate the land live the whole day in the valley, and when night comes
go up to their houses on the heights. Their food is the bread of wheat,
and milk furnished by their herds of cattle (gaómesh, cows, goats, and
sheep), which is their sole property. There are no regular Bazárs even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_4_Page_6" id="Appendix_4_Page_6">[6]</a></span>
in the large villages; but the arrival of a merchant from India is generally
hailed throughout the country. The woollen cloth which they use
generally is manufactured by them.</p>

<p><i>Marriage.</i>—Very lately there was a custom amongst them that the young
man was allowed to court any girl he wished; but now, from their contact
with the Afghans, the system of “betrothal” at a very early age is introduced,
and the boy does not go till his marriage to that part of the village
in which the girl betrothed to him lives. The Kohistanis say that they
have learned three things from the Afghans:—</p>

<p>(1) The use of leathern shoes,</p>

<p>(2) The use of long swords and guns,</p>

<p>(3) The system of betrothal.</p>

<p>That part of the country lying at the foot of the Hindu Kush mountains,
which is bounded on the north by Kokand and Karatigan, on the
east by Durwaz, on the south by Badakhshan and the Amu, on the west
by Sherabad and Hissar (belonging to Bukhara) is called <i>Khatlan</i> ‎‏ختلان‏‎.
<span class="smcap">Koláb</span>, a considerable town containing a population of about ten thousand,
is situated at the distance of five miles from the northern bank of the Amu,
and is the capital of the province. The other towns of note are <i>Muminabad</i>
‎‏مؤمن اباد‏‎, Daulatabad ‎‏دولتاباد‏‎, Khawaling ‎‏خوالنگ‏‎, Baljawan
‎‏بلجوان‏‎, and Sarchashmá ‎‏سرچشمہ‏‎.</p>

<p>The country, being situated at the foot of mountains, and being watered
by numerous streams, is highly fertile. The most important products are
rice, wheat, barley, kharpazá, etc.; and the people generally are agricultural.</p>

<p>There is a mine of salt in the mountains of ‎‏خواجه مؤمن‏‎ <i>Khawaja Mumin</i>;
and the salt produced resembles the Lahori salt, though it is not so
pure and shining, and is very cheap.</p>

<p>Cattle breeding is carried on on a great scale, and the wealth of a man
is estimated by the number of cattle he possesses. There is a kind of
goat in this country which yields a very soft kind of wool (called Tibit);
and the people of Kolah prepare from it hoses and a kind of turban, called
<i>Shamali</i> (from shamal, the northern wind, from which it gives shelter).</p>

<p><i>Religion.</i>—Generally the whole of the population belongs to the Sunni
sect (according to the Hanafi rite).</p>

<p><i>Tribes.</i>—The population of the country is divided into <i>Laqai</i>, <i>Battash</i>,
and <i>Tajiks</i>. The Laqais live in movable tents (khargah) like the Kirghiz,
and lead a roving life, and are soldiers and thieves by profession. The
Battashes live in villages, which are generally clusters of <i>kappás</i> (thatched
cottages), and are a peaceful and agricultural people. The Tajiks live in
the towns, and are mostly artisans.</p>

<p><i>Language.</i>—Turki is spoken in the villages and a very corrupt form of
Persian in the towns. Most of the words are so twisted and distorted
that a Persian cannot understand the people of the country without effort.</p>

<p><i>Government.</i>—The country is really a province of Bukhárá; but a native
of Kolab, descended from the Kapchaqs by the father’s and from the
Laqais by the mother’s side, became independent of Bukhará. After his
death, his four sons, Sayer Khan, Sara Khan, Qamshin Khan, Umra
Khan, fought with one another for the crown; and Sara Khan, having
defeated the other three, came to be the Chief of the province, but was
defeated by an army from Bukhará and escaped to Kabul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_4_Page_8" id="Appendix_4_Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>When Najmuddin left his country, it was governed by a servant of the
court of Bukhárá.</p>

<p>The houses are generally built of mud, cut into smooth and symmetrical
walls, and are plastered by a kind of lime called <i>guch</i>. Burnt bricks are
very rare, and only the palace of the governor is made partially of them.
The walls are roofed by thatch made of “damish” (reeds), which grow
abundantly on the banks of the Amoo.</p>

<p>The <i>dress</i> consists of long, flowing choghás (stuffed with cotton) and
woollen turbans. The Khatlanis wear a kind of full boot which they call
<i>chamush</i>, but lately a kind of shoe is introduced from Russia, and is called
<i>nughai</i>.</p>

<p>The country is connected with Yarkand by two roads, one running
through Kokand and the other through the Pamir.</p>

<p>The above and following accounts were in answer to questions by Dr.
Leitner, whose independent researches regarding Kandiá in 1866-72 were
thus corroborated in 1881, and again in 1886, when the photographs which
serve as the basis of our illustrations were taken.</p>

<h4>IV. THE LANGUAGE, CUSTOMS, SONGS, AND PROVERBS OF GABRIÁL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Position.</span>—A town in <i>Kandiá</i>, a part of Yaghistan (the independent,
or wild, country) situated beyond the river Indus (Hawā-sinn), which
separates it from <i>Chilás</i>. The country of <i>Kandiá</i> extends along both
sides of the <i>Kheri Ghá</i>, a tributary of the Indus, and is separated from
<i>Tangir</i> by a chain of mountains.</p>

<p>The town of <i>Gabriál</i> is situated three days’ march from <i>Jalkôt</i>, in a north-west
direction, and is one day’s march from <i>Patan</i>, in a northerly direction.
<i>Patan</i> is the chief city of Southern Kandiá.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inhabitants.</span>—The whole tract of Kandiá can send out 20,000
fighting men. They are divided into the following castes:—</p>

<p>(1) Shîn, the highest, who now pretend to be Quraishes, the Arabs of
the tribe to which the Prophet Muhammad belonged. (Harif Ullá, the
Gabriáli, and Ghulam Mohammad, of Gilgit, <i>call themselves Quraishes</i>.)</p>

A Yashkun man cannot marry a <i>Shîn</i> woman. Ahmad Shah, the Jalkoti

<p>The people of <i>Northern Kandiá</i> (Gabriál) are called <i>Bunzárî</i>, and of
the southern part (<i>i.e.</i>, Patan) <i>Maní</i>, as the Chilasis are called <i>Boté</i>. A
foreigner is called <i>Raráwi</i>, and fellow-countryman, <i>Muqámi</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Religion.</span>—The Gabriális, as well as all the people of <i>Chilás</i>, <i>Patan</i>,
and <i>Palas</i>, are Sunnis, and are very intolerant to the <i>Shias</i>, who are kidnapped
and kept in slavery (Ghulam Mohammad, the Gilgiti, has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_4_Page_9" id="Appendix_4_Page_9">[9]</a></span>
for many years a slave in Chilás, as Ahmad Shah reports). The Gabriális
were converted to Muhammadanism by a saint named <i>Bâbâji</i>, whose
shrine is in Gabriál, and is one of the most frequented places by pilgrims.
The Gabriális say that this saint lived six or seven generations ago. Mir
Abdulla (who is really of Afghanistan, but now lives in Gabriál,) says that
the Gabriális were converted to Islám about 150 years ago. Lately, this
religion has made great progress among the people of Kandiá generally.
Every little village has a mosque, and in most of the towns there are
numerous mosques with schools attached to them, which are generally
crowded by students from every caste. In Gabriál, the Mullahs or priests
are, for the most part, of the Shîn caste, but men of every caste are zealous
in giving education to their sons. Their education is limited to Muhammadan
law (of the Hanifite school), and Arabian logic and philosophy.
Very little attention is paid to Arabic or Persian general literature and
caligraphy, that great Oriental art; so little, indeed, that Harifullah and
Mir Abdulla, who are scholars of a very high standard, are wholly ignorant
of any of the caligraphic forms, and their handwriting is scarcely better
than that of the lowest primary class boys in the schools of the Punjab.</p>

<p>The most accomplished scholar in Kandiá is the high priest and chief
of Patan, named Hazrat Ali, who is a Shîn.</p>

<p>The people generally are peaceful, and have a fair complexion and
erect bearing. Their social and moral status has lately been raised very
high. Robbery and adultery are almost unknown, and the usual punishment
for these crimes is death. Divorce is seldom practised; polygamy is
not rare among the rich men (wadán), but is seldom found among the
common people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Government.</span>—Every village or town is governed by a Council of
elders, chosen from among every tribe or “taífa.” The most influential
man among these elders for the time being is considered as the chief of the
Council. These elders are either Shîns or Yashkun. No Kamìn can be
elected an elder, though he may become a Mullá, but a Mulla-kamìn also
cannot be admitted to the Council.</p>

<p>The reigning Council of Gabriál consists of 12 persons, of whom 9 are
Shins and 3 Yashkuns. Patshé Khân is the present chief of the Council.
The post of Chief of the Council is not hereditary, but the wisest and
the most influential of the elders is elected to that post. Justice is administered
by the Mullahs without the interference of the Council, whose
operation is limited to inter-tribal feuds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Customs and Manners.</span>—Hockey on horseback, which is called
“lughât” in Gabriál, is played on holidays; and the place where they
meet for the sport is called “lughât-kárin-jha.”</p>

<p>Guns are called “nâli” in Gabriál, and are manufactured in the town
by blacksmiths.</p>

<p>Dancing is not practised generally, as in the other Shin countries.
Only “Doms” dance and sing, as this is their profession; they play on
the “surúi” (pipe), rabáb (harp), and shaṇdo (drum).</p>

<p>The “purdá” system, or “veiling” women, is prevalent among the
gentry, but it is only lately that the system was introduced into this country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_4_Page_10" id="Appendix_4_Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>When a son is born, a musket is fired off, and the father of the newborn
son gives an ox as a present to the people, to be slaughtered for a
general festival.</p>

<p>Infanticide is wholly unknown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marriage.</span>—The father of the boy does not go himself, as in Gilgit, to
the father of the girl, but sends a man with 5 or 6 rupees, which he offers
as a present. If the present is accepted, the betrothal (lóli) is arranged.
As far as the woman is concerned the “lóli” is inviolable. The usual
sum of dowry paid in cash is 80 rupees.</p>

<p>A bride is called “zhiyán,” and the bridegroom “zhiyán lo.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Language.</span>—On account of the want of intercourse between the tribes
the language of Kohistan is broken into numerous dialects; thus the
structure of the dialects spoken in Kandiá, <i>i.e.</i>, in Gabriál and Patan,
differs from that of the language spoken in Chilás and Palus, <i>i.e.</i>, in the
countries situated on this side of the Indus. Harifullah, a Gabriáli, did
not understand any language except his own; but Ahmad Shah, an
inhabitant of Jalkôt (situated in the southern part of Chilás), understood
Gabriáli, as he had been there for a time. Ghulam Mohammad, our
Gilgiti man, who had been captured in an excursion, and had lived as a
slave in Chilás, also thoroughly understood Jalkóti.</p>

<p>The language of Kohistan (as Chilás, Kandiá, etc., are also called) is
divided into two dialects, called <i>Shéná</i> and <i>Shúthun</i> respectively. In the
countries situated on that side of the Indus, that is in Kandiá, Shúthun is
spoken.</p>

<p>The following pages are devoted to <i>Ballads</i>, <i>Proverbs</i>, <i>Riddles</i>, and
<i>Dialogues</i> in the Shúthun dialect.</p>

<p><i>Songs</i> = Gíla. Meshón gíla = men’s songs; Gharón gíla = female songs.</p>

<h5>1. <span class="smcap">An Elegy.</span></h5>

<p>Fifteen years ago a battle was fought between <i>Arslán Khan</i> of <i>Kali</i>, and
<i>Qamar Ali Khan</i> of <i>Pálus</i>, in which 300 men were killed on both sides.
<i>Phaju</i>, on whose death the elegy is written by his sister, was one of the
killed. The inhabitants of Palus are called “Sikhs,” in reproach.</p>

<p>2. The following song is a chârbait, or quatrain, composed by Qamrán,
a Gabriali poet. The song treats of the love between Saif-ul-mulk, a prince
of Rúm, and Shahparì (the Fairy-queen).</p>

<p>The first line of a <i>charbait</i> is called <i>Sarnâmâh</i>, and the remaining poem
is divided into stanzas or “Khhàṛáo,” consisting each of four lines. At the

kingi bhíl nithi</i>.</p>

<p>Is there any water on the road? <i>paú
mazé wi thú ya na thú</i> (way-in

<p>The water is bad and salty, <i>achhak

<p>There is a big river on the road,
which you will not be able to
cross, <i>pánda mazé, ghái sin thi,
pir-khingí</i> (on that side) <i>ni biháṇt</i>.</p>

<p>Why? Is there no bridge? <i>ginah?

<p>Your loads are very heavy, <i>tíṇ aíṇ</i>

<p>I beg that you will make your loads
a little lighter, and then you will
arrive quicker, <i>mi arzí thi, as peté

<p>Be patient; I will pay for all; I
will give the rate to the coolies.

<h4>DESCRIPTION OF JAMSHÉD, THE SIAH PÔSH KAFIR.</h4>

<p>Jamshêd of Katár, the nephew of General Feramorz, the renowned Kafir
General in the service of the late Amir Sher Alí of Kabul, was a
confidential orderly both in the service of the Amir Sher Alí and in that
of Yakúb Khan, whose cause he espoused against that of his father, in
consequence of which, when his master was imprisoned, he fled to Rawalpindi,
where he came to me. He had witnessed some of the most exciting
scenes in modern Kabul history, had risen to the rank of Major, and had
served with Prince Iskandar of Herát, whom he afterwards again met in
London.</p>

<p>In 1872 I published from Jamshêd’s dictation an account of the
“Adventures of Jamshèd, a Siah Pôsh Kafir, and his wanderings with
Amir Sher Alí,” and also “a statement about slavery in Kabul, etc.,”
which contained the names of places and tribes previously unknown to
Geographers and Ethnographers, as well as historical and political material,
the value of which has been proved by subsequent events. I took him with
me to England, not only on account of the interest which exists in certain
scientific quarters as regards the “mysterious race” of which he was a
member, but also in order to draw the attention of the Anti-slavery Society
and of Government to the kidnapping of Kafirs—the supposed “poor
relations” of the European—which is carried on by the Afghans.</p>

<p>His measurement was taken, according to the systems of both Broca
and Schwarz (of the Novara expedition), by Dr. Beddoe, and the type
appeared to approach nearest to that of the slavonized Macedonians of the
Herzegovina, like one of whose inhabitants he looked, thus creating far
less attention, especially when dressed <i>à l’européenne</i> in Europe, than he
did at Lahore, where Lord Northbrook saw him. The Anti-slavery Society
sent him to the Chiefs of Katár with a communication to the effect that
Englishmen strongly disapproved of slavery, and that they should represent
their case to the Panjab Government. A curious incident in connection
with his presence in England may be mentioned. It was the 6th May, 1874,
the day of the “Two Thousand”; the result of the Newmarket race was
eagerly expected, when the <i>Globe</i> came out with the following titles placed
on the posters: “Result of the ‘Two Thousand.’” “An Interesting Race”
(the latter was an article on the race of the Siah Pôsh Kafirs). The result
may be imagined. Hundreds of Welshers plunged into an account of the
Siah Pôsh Kafirs under the notion that they were going to have a great
treat in a telegraphic description of a Newmarket race. I was informed
that the wrath of the sporting roughs who besieged the office was awful
when they found out their mistake. Poor Jamshêd was seen across the
Panjab border by one of my Munshis, but returned some months later to
Lahore, whence he found his way to Brussa, in Asia Minor. It is supposed
that he took service in the Turkish Army, but he has not since been
heard of. As I intend to publish an account of the Káfirs of Katár (now,
I fear, all Nimchas, or half-Muhammadans), Gambir, etc., I reserve the interesting
statements of Jamshêd to their proper Section in my “Káfiristán.”</p>

<h3 id="APPENDIX_VI">APPENDIX VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">A ROUGH ACCOUNT, COLLECTED IN 1886, OF ITINERARIES
IN THE “NEUTRAL ZONE” BETWEEN CENTRAL ASIA
AND INDIA. By <span class="smcap">Raja Khushwaqtia and Dr. G. W. Leitner</span>.</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Route I.</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">From Gilgit to Kabul</span>, viâ Dareyl, Tangir, Kandiá, Ujù, Torwál,
Swat, Dir, Maidán, Jandūl, Bajaur, Muravarri, Pashàt, Kunèr, Jelalabad,
Kabul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gilgit to Sherkila</span>, 9 katsha (rough) kôs<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> (1½ miles), ruled by Isa
Bahadur’s son, Raja Akbar Khan, under Kashmīr, a faithful ally, contains
70 zemindars’ (peasants’) houses on the Yasin river.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sherkila to Patàri</span> (is uninhabited), over a ridge Pīr (17 katsha kôs)
called Batrèt, which is a plateau on which the Dareylis graze their flocks in
the spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patàri to Yatshōt</span> (12 katsha kôs), road stony and jungly. Yatshōt
is a village of Dareyl of one hundred houses, occupied by zemindars
who have cattle, sheep, goats, and <i>buffaloes</i> (which are not found in
Badakhshan). The ground produces much white maize (from which
bread is made), wheat, barley, grapes growing to a gigantic size, nuts, etc.
There is excellent water, but it is very cold. The people are Sunnis, and
speak Shiná (the dialect of Chilás). [The Shins appear to have been a
Hindu tribe expelled from Kashmir territory and converted to a sort of
Muhammadanism, both Shiah and Sunni. They are the highest caste in
Dardistan; but, instead of the Brahminical veneration for the cow, they
abhor everything connected with it—its flesh and milk—and only touch its
calf at the end of a prong.] Yatshōt has two mosques, and Mullas who
understand Arabic well. The Dareylis are very religious, and attentive
to their ceremonial practices. The streamlet of Dareyl runs past it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yatshōt to Manikál</span>, 3 katsha kôs, a plain easy march through a
prairie. Manikál has two forts, one of which has about 500 houses, and is
called Dòrkans; and the other, Manikál proper, which has 300 houses
and an old Mosque. Manikál is surrounded by forests. When the
Kashmīr troops reached Manikál, the Dareylis, after fighting, burned down
their old fort rather than surrender. There are many Mullas and disciples
there, some coming from Peshawar, Swat, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manikál to Samangál</span>, 3 katsha kôs, over an inhabited plain. The
fort contains 800 houses. A great elder (Djashtero) called Kalashmīr
resides there, whom all the Dareylis respect and follow, although there are
many other Djashteros, like Muqaddams (elders, mayors), in Kashmir
villages. He is wise and rich, possessing, perhaps, in addition to cattle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_6_Page_2" id="Appendix_6_Page_2">[2]</a></span>
etc., 5 or 6 thousand tolas of gold; and he has one wife and two or three
children. Persian is read there in addition to Arabic. There is also
another fort containing 500 houses, also called Samangál, a few hundred
yards from the first. In fact, Dareyl, although a small country, is thickly
populated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samangál to Pùgutsh</span>, a fort, with 500 houses, 2 katsha kôs—thence
1 katsha kôs to Gayál, a fort with 600 houses—all an easy road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gayál to Kàmi</span>, Fort Tangīr, over a high mountain called Kùbbekunn,
very windy, and wooded. Water must be taken with one when
starting from Gayál, as none is found before reaching Rîm, a small village
of 20 houses, on the Tangīr side. The road for 8 kôs is difficult, being
an ascent of 4 kôs on each side. From Rîm to Tangīr the road is good,
water abundant, and habitations numerous. Kàmi fort has 1,000 houses
of Gujars (a shepherd and cowherd tribe that is found following its
peaceful occupation, either as settlers or nomads, in the most dangerous
districts), and zemindars, who are tributaries to Yasin, paying taxes in
gold and kind. There is a direct road from Tangīr to Yasin, viâ Satìl—6
kôs, plain, with many Gujars, paying their grazing tax in gold; thence
over a small peak, Mayiréy, to the plateau of Batrêt, 8 katsha kôs. (See
second stage of this route.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From Batrêt to Ràushan</span>, over a small mountain. Ràushan is a
small fort of Yasin, whence there are roads to Yasin, Chitrál, Gilgit, etc.
Gold is washed from the Indus, which is 3 katsha kôs from Kàmi. The
Tangīris are braver than the Dareylis and equally religious, having many
Mullas; but the country, although larger, is not so well populated as Dareyl,
the people of which are also rather shepherds than hunters. The <i>Gabár</i>
are the ruling people in Tangīr, about 1,000 families, of which 500 are in
Kàmi. They are the old proprietors of the country, and are all Shins
who <i>now</i> have given up their old aversion to the cow, its flesh and milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kàmi</span>, over the mountain Tràk, called by the Pathans Chaudunno, which
has no snow on the Tangīr side, but a snow-covered plateau 1½ kôs long
on the Kandiá side. Then comes a green plain. To the foot of the
mountain Tràk on the Tangīr side 11 kôs pakka (11 good kôs, or nearly
22 miles), over a tree-covered plain. Then over the Tràk pass and
plateau, the road goes along a plain which extends for 17 kôs to
<span class="smcap">Gabriál</span>. There are a great many Gujars along the road. [The road to
Yasin is through the Gujar-frequented district of Kuranjá, belonging to
Tangīr. Multán is the Muqaddam of the Gujars, a brave man.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gabriál</span> has only 40 houses, but the country of Gabriál generally is
studded with habitations. The famous Mullah Habîbulla, a relative of
Raja Khushwaqtia, is a most influential man among Kohistanis. His tribe
is Mullakheyl, and all the Gujars of Kandiá are obedient to him. The
Mullakheyl are Shîns, but Yashkuns also live there. Yashkuns are the
peasantry of Dardistan, including Hunza, and supposed to be aborigines,
though some derive the Yashkuns of Hunza from the white Yuechi, or
Huns, and others give them a Western origin. They have always been
Sunnis. (The Dareylis were formerly Shiahs.) (See detailed account of
Gabriál by one of its Maulvis, Mir Abdullah, and of Kandiá or Kiliá,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_6_Page_3" id="Appendix_6_Page_3">[3]</a></span>
translated by Dr. G. W. Leitner.) The people of Kandiá are wealthy in
flocks, ghi (= clarified butter, exported to Peshawur, 18 to 25 pakka seers
for the rupee). It is subject to Yasin. They possess double or Indian
rupees and mahmudshahis, some having 10 or 20 thousand rupees.
The poorest have 10 to 12 cows, 100 sheep, etc. The greatest among the
Gujars intermarry with Yasin chiefs. The Kohistanis are independent,
but the Gujars pay a tribute to Yasin. The Samu or Samasi village is 2
kôs from Gabriál. From Gabriál, ½ kôs distant, is a mountain called by
the same name, with an ascent of five to six pakka kôs, with excellent
water; road only open in summer. A descent of 5 kôs brings one to
<i>Ushu</i>, a big village of 600 houses inhabited by Bashkaris. (See special
account by Dr. Leitner of Bashkar and its language.) The Swat river
touches it. The Bashkaris pay a small tribute to Yasin, but are practically
independent. They are generally on good terms with the Torwaliks,
who were formerly their rulers. The languages of Torwal and
Bashkar are different.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From Ushù to Torwál</span>, 13 kôs, very bad, stony road, after Kalám
(2 miles from Ushù). Torwál has 200 houses. They are not so rich as
the people of Kandiá and Jalkôt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From Torwál to Branihál</span>, the frontier of Torwál, 12 to 13 kôs, a
bad stony road, 600 houses and a Bazár in which there are 5 or 6 Hindu
merchants. [The Hindu traders are not molested in Yaghistán (“the
wild land” as Dardistán, the country between Kabul and Kashmir is often
called), because no one is afraid of them; whereas if a Sahib (English
man) came, people would be afraid.] There are many wealthy people in
Branihál, which may be considered to be the capital of Torwál.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Branihál to Swat</span>, a plain; at only 1½ kôs is Shagrám, composed of
3 villages, under the children of the Sayad (descendant of the prophet
Muhammad), Pir Bâba. The three villages are inhabited by Sayads and
contain 500 houses. Then to Tiráh (1 mile, a plain), where the Mîna
or Akhunkheyls live (300 houses).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tiráh to Landéy</span>, 1 kôs pakka, a Patán village, in which rice grows,
beginning from Branihál; Landéy to Lalkún (a small village away from the
big road to Hoti Murdan) 5 kôs, a plain. Thence Fazil banda, 12 kôs, a
plain; thence to a mountain, Barkànn, 12 kôs, a plain, leaving the Swat
for the Dīr territory. Jarughey (hamlet of Gujars) is the halting-place.
From Jarughey into the Dara of Ushuréy, in Yaghistan proper; it is the
home of the Khan of Dīr, and is inhabited by the Panda Kheyl tribe.
Halt at Jàbar, a village 14 kôs from Jarughey, a fairly inhabited road.
From Jàbar to Maidán (16 kôs) by the mountain Káir Dara, and passing
the fort Bībiól (100 houses) a fort of the Khan of Dīr. The mountain
is high. Maidán fort and Bazar, and Bandey fort (500 houses), Kumbàr
1 kôs distant, 1,000 houses, of Mīans, and Bazar with many Hindus.
Thence to Bandey Mayár, a great Bazár, and a renowned Ziáret (shrine),
and Langar (almshouse) of Saukanó Mīân, a village of Peshawar, are
2,000 or 3,000 houses, belonging to Jandūl. It is 14 kôs distant from
Maidán, over an inhabited plain. Umr Khan, the ruler, has 240 excellent
horsemen, 3,000 infantry, fights with Dīr, who has 500 inferior horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_6_Page_4" id="Appendix_6_Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and numerous footmen, but not so brave as Jandúl. Terkanì is the name
of the Jandúl ruler and tribe up to Jellalabad, and Irubsì that of Dîr,
Swat, Buneyr, Samè, Pakli, etc. At 1½ kôs of Mayar is Miákil, a big town,
of 5,000 houses and a Bazar. Miákil to (Bajaur) Badâm, are Kakazis, of
the Mamùnd tribe, for 16 kôs a plain, 400 houses, Yágis (wild); Badàm to
<i>Mureweri</i>, are 16 kôs, over a small mountain (Mohmands) in Yaghistan, has
1,000 houses. (At Nawagai is a Khan, Ajdar Khan, with 20 horsemen
and 3,000 footmen.) At Khàr was another Khán, Dilawar Khan, who
fled to Peshawar, his place having been conquered by Ajdar Khan; 100
houses. The place is surrounded by the Tuman-kheyl tribe. On the other
side of the river, Kabul rule begins, and opposite is Chagar Sarai, leading
to Katár, once a stronghold of Kafirs. Gambīr is subject to Kabul, the
rest of the Siah Posh being independent; and another road leads to Petsh,
which is Yági, or independent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From Muraweri to Pashùtt</span>, 5 or 6 kôs pakka. Below Muraweri,
2 kôs, is Serkanni, where there are 200 Kabul troops. From Pashùtt
cross stream on jhallas (inflated skins) to Jelalabad, 20 or 22 kôs; whence
the road to Kabul is too well known to need even a passing reference.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Uninteresting as rough accounts of itineraries may be to the general
reader, they are not without importance to the specialist. My material on
the subject of routes to, and through, the Hindu-kush territories is considerable,
though necessarily defective. It was mainly collected in 1866-72,
when a portion of it was used by that leader of men, General Sir Charles
MacGregor. I published a few “routes” at various intervals in the hope
of stimulating inquiry, and of eliciting corrections or further information;
but Indian official Departments, instead of co-operating, are uncommunicative
of the partial, and therefore often misleading, knowledge which they
possess, and, above all, jealous of non-official specialists. The First part of
my work on Hunza has recently been printed by the Indian Foreign Office;
where and when the Second will appear, is doubtful. I think the public have
a right to know how matters stand in what was once called “the neutral
zone,” the region between the Russian and the British spheres of influence
in Asia. At any rate, the learned Societies and International Oriental and
other Congresses, that, on the strength of the material already published,
have done me the honour at various times to apply with but very partial success,
to Government on behalf of the elaboration of my material, shall not be
deprived of it, though I can only submit it to them in its rough primitive
state. The reader of <i>The Asiatic Quarterly Review</i> will, I hope, not be
deterred by the dulness of “routes” from glancing at material which, in
future articles, will include accounts, however rough, of the languages, the
history and Governments, the customs, legends, and songs of, perhaps,
the most interesting countries and races in Asia. The information, often
collected under circumstances of danger, is based on personal knowledge,
and on the accounts of natives of position in the countries to be dealt with.</p>

<h3 id="ITINERARIES">ROUGH ACCOUNTS OF ITINERARIES THROUGH THE
HINDUKUSH AND TO CENTRAL ASIA.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Dr. G. W. Leitner.</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Route II.</span></h4>

<p>In connection with my note in “Routes in Dardistan,” I now propose
to publish a series of accounts which have been supplied to me by native
Indian or Central Asian travellers of position and trustworthiness, and
which cannot fail, whatever their scientific or literary deficiencies, to be of
topographical and ethnographical, if not of political, value. I commence
with the account of a loyal native Chief, who has had opportunities of comparing
Russian with British administration. The Chief first passes quickly
from <span class="smcap">Jelalabad to Gandamak</span>, thence to Tazîn, Butkhák, Balahisár
(where he left his sword with D... S...); he then proceeds from <span class="smcap">Kabul
to Chalikár</span>, (a distance of 17 kôs over a plain); then stops at the <i>Salán</i>
village, at the foot of the Hindukush, 11 kôs, and then goes on to say:
“<i>Salán</i>: one road goes to the Hindukush and one to <i>Bajgá</i> (a halt) 14 kôs,<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
over a mountain into Afghan Turkistan. <i>Anderáb</i>, district of <i>Kundûz</i>,
17 kôs, plain; Anderáb to Bazderá; then Baghbán; then Robât (where
there is a camp of Kabul troopers against Uzbak robbers), 14 k. in Haibak
district to Haibak town; stayed at a small place of Tashkurghán, which
has 6,000 houses, and is held by a Risála (troop) of the Amir; stayed at an
intermediate cantonment established by Kabul; then to Mazari Sharif, 13
kôs (all belonging to Balkh). Daulatabad (300 houses); thence to the
river Amu over a Rēg (sandy and dusty place) <i>in a buggy of two horses</i>,
paid three double rupees,<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> took water with us (20 kôs). There are 100 men
over the ferry for protection against raiding Turkomans. Sherdil Khan
Loináb gave me a passport to visit the Ziárat (shrine) of Khaja Bahauddin
Naqshbandi, at Bokhára. Went on ferry with 100 cattle and 50 men
all day long, to the village of Talashkhán (500 h.) in Bokhára territory,
where we rested in the evening. Next day by road to Sherabad, 7 kôs,
plain (2,500 h.); then to Chinarì (600 houses), passing the <i>Khirga</i> Nishin
Khirghiz and Uzbak, “living in huts” (also Zemindars); Cheshma-i-Hafiz,
40 h., and a Serai for travellers. Then again on to the plain; made a
halt among the Khirga-nishīn. Next day went on to the large city of
Ghuzár (250,000 inhabitants, with villages, etc.). (Thence to Karshi to
Bokhára); thence to Karabagh (700 houses); to town of Chiraghtshi in
Shehrsabz (Ch. has 3,000 h.), whence it is four miles distant. Shehrsabz is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_6_Page_6" id="Appendix_6_Page_6">[6]</a></span>
a beautiful place of 6,000 houses. (The Bokhára army has a band in
Russian style, and is drilled in a Russian way; it is better fed and clad
than are the Afghans, but it is not so brave.) Thence to Kitáb, 3,000
houses, and Bokhára troops; did not stay there, but went to Takhta
Karatsha, 10 kôs: thence to Kurghantippé Bazár; thence to <i>Samarcand</i>,
a paradise (500,000 inhabitants, two rivers); there is a Hákim and General,
the place belongs to the White Czar = the Ak Padishah. There were 12
regiments of infantry, and 8 of cavalry there. Then to Jám, 4 kôs (a large
Russian force), 12 regiments of infantry, 4 of cavalry. I stayed with A.R. at
Samarcand. There is a Russian cantonment between Jezakh and Samarcand,
Kōr, Khoshgurù. <i>The guns everywhere are directed towards Yasin, or
India.</i> I was nowhere molested in visiting Russian cantonments. Jezakh,
Tamburabad, little Bokhara; Zamīn, Uratippa, a great town, and among
40,000 inhabitants there are 6 battalions and 8 regiments of infantry; Náu in
Khojend district. Then Khojend, 800,000 inhabitants, great army; Mahràm,
Besharìh in Khokand, then to the city of Khokand; Karawultippa, 8 kôs,
plain, Murghilán, a big city, 350,000 inhabitants with villages; Mintippé,
3,000 houses (or inhabitants?), Arabán; Ush, a large army (Kashghár is
eleven days’ march). Induján, big Russian army; 150,000 (inhabitants).
Then to the Kokand river, Derya Sîr, crossing to Namangán, big city
and army, thence returned to Induján, then to Asáka, 8 kôs plain,
9,000 inhabitants and army (1 cavalry, 4 infantry), then to Shahrikhán,
6 kôs, big city, 8,000 inhabitants or houses; then to Kawa, 5 kôs.
Utshkurghán, 10 kôs, big city in Khokand: thence into a valley to a
Langar, 17 kôs, plain, at night, where there are Khirghiz subjects to
Khokand; over a mountain into Alai, 13 kôs, plain of Pamīr, inhabited
by Khirghiz, very cold; then to Chaghalmak, 15 kôs, plain, a
small village, 100 houses of Khirghiz. District of Karateghin, which is
subject to Bokhara (Alai being under the Russians); Chaghalmak to
Zankù, 16 kôs, plain (horses are to be found everywhere for hire, according
to distance by Farsang). At Samarcand one mule’s wheat load = two
double rupees; a big sheep costs one rupee, and one and a half long-tailed
sheep at Khokand, also one rupee. The fat of sheep is used
instead of Ghi. Gold and notes abound more than silver. (Abdurrahman
received 700 tungas = 350 rupees per day, for self and eighty followers.)
Silk Atlas one and a half yards is sold for one rupee. The
Russian ladies are well dressed, and great respect is shown to them. The
officers are very polite. There are free dispensaries, and schools in which
Russian and the Korán are taught. (Haldi and black pepper from India
is dear); there is no tyranny, and they are exactly like the English; the
Russians live in bungalows. The Kázis and the man who beats the drum
at night for Ramazan are paid by the Russians; sanitation is well attended
to; all the troops are Europeans, except the Noghais, who are Tartars.
I was much struck at Khojend by seeing the cavalry mounted according
to the colour of the horses. (Gold is said to come from Kashgar and
Khokand, but I have not seen the mine.) Camels abound and are eaten.
Zankù to Kila-i Lab-i Ab (300 houses), 16 kôs, plain, to a village Shòkh
darà (300 houses).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_6_Page_7" id="Appendix_6_Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a fine country; the people talk Persian, and are Sunnis (belongs to
Bokhára).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kila-i Lab-i Ab</span>, governed by a Bokhára Kardár, called Hákim Muhammad
Nazir Beg, at a Fort Gharm to Shughdaréy, 12 kôs, plain, on horseback
all along to Samarcand (300 h.), Shughdaréy to Fort Gharm, 3 k. (1,500
houses or inhabitants), Gharm to Childará, a village in Derwáz, plain, 17 k.
packa (buggies do not go there), 150 h.; thence to Khawaling, Bazar, 1,000
h. (in the District of <i>Koláb</i>), 17 kôs, plain; carriages can go; thence to the
city of Koláb 14 kôs, plain (Koláb is under Bokhára) (was formerly
governed by Kartshîn Khan, a raider), whose brother Serakhan is at
Kábul. Koláb, 6,000 houses, is a fine city, and there are six other cities
belonging to it (Khawaling, Kungár, etc.); thence to Sar-i-Chashma, 10
kôs, plain; carriages can go (200 houses); thence to Baràk, 40 h. on the
Amu 4 kôs, a warm place like Koláb generally; cross into Samptì (60 h.),
in the district of <i>Rosták</i>, belonging to Badakhshán (paid 4 annas for conveyance
of five horses costing me 3 tolas in Koláb = 30 rupees); to Chayáp
city, 2,000 houses (Jews are wealthy and not oppressed, and at Koláb
there are Jews and Hindus, the latter with no families). Jews wear front
curls, and have furs; women are handsome, but are dressed like Mussulman
women; men, however, wear caps and narrow trousers, not turbans, as a
rule, or wide trousers. The Jews in Turkestan are very clean. “<i>They
have a learning like the Shastras of the Pandits.</i>” They lend money to the
Khan of Bokhára. (The utensils are of china.)</p>

<p>Mare’s milk is much consumed cooked with meat, and has a highly
intoxicant effect. Chayàp to <i>Rosták</i>, 8 kôs, plain, 2 Afghan regiments of
cavalry, 4 regiments of infantry (there are also some troops at Chayàp) 4,000
houses. Bazár well-frequented; springs; is a hot place. Atunjuláb, 12 kôs,
plain, carriages can go (60 houses); Faizabád 16 kôs, great city and large
Afghan force (3,500 houses?). I stayed at Bárak, 10 kôs; a nice place for
illustrious strangers (100 houses); plenty of Zemindars, very easy, plain, full
of fruit (apples, apricots, etc.); Chaugarán 9 kos, plain (200 houses); Tirgarán
(60 houses, of <span class="smcap">Muláis</span>, the strange sect regarding which elsewhere)
11 kôs, plain, with the exception of a small bad bit, over which horses, how
ever, can go, called Rafàq = Parrì in Punjabi. From Tirgarán to Zerkhan
in Zebák, 14 kôs, plain, but carriages cannot go. Zebák is a fine cool
place. Its great Mulai, Sayed Abdurrahim, has fled to Arkari in Chitrál.
Zerkhan has 500 Khassadars of Kabul (even the infantry there have
horses), and 150 houses. Zerkhan to Shikashìm, small fort, 11 kôs, plain,
300 houses in villages all round; it is now well garrisoned with Kabulis
(2 k. from Shikashìm are the ruby mines worked in winter near Gharàn on
the road to Shignán). (In the time of Mir Shah rubies as large as candles
were said to be got, lighting up the place.) “Lajvard” (Lapis lazuli)
is got from Yumgan, a village in mountain above Jirm in Badakhshan.
“Lajvard” is sold at a rupee of a Rupee size. (Gold streaks are often found
in it.) Shikashìm to Kazi-deh, 10 kôs, plain (carriages could go) in
Wakhan, which begins at Putr about half kôs from Shikashìm (another road
from Shikashìm to Shignán in two days <i>viâ</i> Ghasann 10 kôs, plain, very
cold); thence 12 kôs to a fort in Shignan. Kazi-deh has 40 houses. Kazi-deh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_6_Page_8" id="Appendix_6_Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to Pigitsh 12 kôs, very plain, 15 houses of very wealthy people, all
Mulais; Shoghōr under Chitrál, 500 houses. Fort over the Khatinza,
Nuqsan and Dura passes from Zeibák all under Chitrál; the first-named
pass is open all the year round, but violent storms blow at the top.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pigitsh to Fort Panjah</span>, a plain 12 kôs; Ali Murdan Khan, its
former ruler, is a refugee with Chitrál; 200 Afghan cavalry; there are 5 or
6 houses in the fort, and a number of villages round it (Zròng, a warm mineral
spring, 40 houses; Kishm, 40 houses, Gatskhòn, 30 houses. Above
Pigitsh are other villages. Khindàt, 50 houses; supplies are most plentiful).</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">Panjah to Zàng</span> (50 houses) 11 kôs, plain (artillery could go);
<span class="smcap">Zàng to Serhadd</span> 12 katcha kôs, 200 houses, plain, cold, much wheat,
cattle, etc.; <i>here the Pamir begins</i>. Thence to Ushàk, 14 k. plain, except
a small elevation, very cold (here there is a road to Yarkand, and another
to Hunza; the Wakhanis graze their cattle and flocks here in winter as
there is abundant grass); <span class="smcap">Ushàk to Langàr</span>, 12 kôs, plain; the roads
divide, of which the left one goes to Sarikol, and the right one to Hunza.
Cattle are kept there in winter by the Serhadd people; Langàr to Baikará
8 kôs plain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barkará to Babagundì</span>, 12 kôs over the Irshád Pir (somewhat steep
and snow-covered on the Wakhan side, but otherwise easy). Here there is
a road on the other side to Babagundì (small town); place for Ghazan
Khan’s cattle (Dannkut). Babagundì is a famous shrine of Pir Irshád,
where even the Mulai Ghazankhan gives cooking pots for travellers, and
makes offerings; there are 5 or 6 houses of Zemindars, who look after the
shrine. (Half a kôs beyond Babagundì the various roads to the Karumbar,
Badakhshan, and one to Hunza join.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Babagundi to Ríshatt</span>; small fort, 11 kôs; inhabited; 5 villagers’
houses employed in agriculture. Ríshatt; for 4 kôs there is a plain road;
then a difficult road, Ráship Jeráb, with precipices (6 kôs from Ríshatt),
which can be destroyed, so as to make the approach from that side very
hazardous; the road continues to Yubkatí, with scarcely much improvement,
for 1½ kôs. There is a small town there, as generally on difficult
defiles, or places than can be defended. Yubkatí to Gircha, 1 kôs katcha
(10 houses); Gircha to Murkhon, 10 houses of Zemindars, 1 kôs; 2 katcha-kôs
comes the Khaibar village of 4 houses, a defile defended by a small
town, <i>with a door shutting the road</i> (<i>Der-band</i>); Khaibar, 4 kôs to Pàss;
road over snow or glacier for 1½ kôs; below the glacier is the village of
Pàss, 25 houses.</p>

<p><i>Pàss</i> to Hussain, 20 houses; also a shrine 1½ kôs; fair road; also a
deep natural tank (hauz) (where there is a place to keep cattle in winter)
a few hundred yards from village. Beyond there is again one of the streaks
of never-melting icefields, and dividing it from Ghulkin, a village of 60
houses (the gardens flourishing in the close vicinity of these icefields).
Immediately near Ghulkin is Gulmùtti, 100 houses; thence for 10 kôs to
Alti, a bad road over an elevation, Refáq, closed by one of the doors to
which I have referred. The door is 1 kôs distant from Gulmùtti. Alti
(150 houses), the residence of Salim Khan, father of Ghazanfar, who built
Balti, where his son, the present ruler of Hunza, Ghazankhan, lives. Balti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_6_Page_9" id="Appendix_6_Page_9">[9]</a></span>
is ½ kôs from Alti, and above it. Balti has 1,000 houses, Zemindars
Muláis; there are 50 Mosques, but no one reads prayers in them; people
build them for the sake of glorification, not worship. They are used for
dancing, drinking, etc. (the Raja used to dance himself on the Naurōz,
and give presents to the Zemindars). Hunza <i>may</i> turn out 2,000 fighting
men. Near it Fort Haiderabad (½ kôs), with 300 houses; close to it is
another fort, Chumarsingh, with 100 houses; near it Dòrkhann Fort, with
200 houses (the inhabitants are more numerous than the wasted ground
can support. People live largely on apricots, etc.; the land is generally
sterile). ½ kôs from Dòrkhann is Gannish Fort, 600 houses, above the
river which divides Hunza from Nagyr, where the Sumeir Fort confronts
Gannish. There is also a small fort near Gannish, called Karál, with 50
houses. (Near Dòrkhann is also a similar small fort, the name of which I
forget.) Coming back to Dòrkhann, and going from it straight in the Gilgit
direction, is Aliabad Fort, with 600 houses, and close to it Hasanabad Fort,
with 100 houses. There is also a “Derrband” between Hasanabad and
Murtezabad, about a mile distant over a stream. Murtezabad has 2 forts,
one with 100, and the other with 50 houses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From Murtezabad to Hirì</span> for two kôs; difficult ascent and descent.
Hirì, a large village, with 800 houses of Zemindars <i>in</i> the fort (Shins live
there); 2 kôs of bad road, excepting about 1 mile; to Mayón, 50 houses.
Four katcha kôs bring one without much difficulty, except over one ascent,
over the Budalèss stream, violent in summer, where there is also a fort
(a warm spring in a fort called Barr, 25 houses, occupied by 20 Sepoys of
the Maharaja) to Chálta, in Gilgit territory, near Budalèss. There is a fort
there, 150 houses, and 100 Sepoys. Over the Nulla, about one kôs above,
is Chaprôt, 50 Sepoys and 60 houses; is a strong position (Natu Shah
came to grief, with 1,000 men, between Budalèss and Mayôn). From
Chálta, crossing the river and a small mountain, is a plateau to Nilt Fort,
in Nagyr territory, 4 kôs from Chálta, and confronting Mayôn. From
Chálta to Nomal, in Gilgit territory, with two Rifáqs each; near to these
respective places for 11 kôs (kacha), 100 houses. There are 20 Sepoys in
the Koti to guard the grain. The Zemindars now live outside the fort,
which is merely used for the storage of grain. From Nomal to Gilgit 12
kôs, plain, which now contains 200 houses.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Route III.</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">From Zeibák to Chitrál</span>, over the Khatinza, a very high Pass, to
Shoghor, or the other passes already mentioned. <i>Viâ</i> the Khatinza, which
is always open, the road from Zeibák to Deh-i-gul, 1 kôs, 25 houses.</p>

<p>There the roads separate, one going over the Nuqsán, which is closed
in winter, and the other one over the Khatinza, both joining at Kurubakh,
a place ensconced by stones, and about 5 kôs either way from Deh-i-gul;
from Kurubakh to Owîr, 20 houses, 3 kôs, easy road; from Owîr to Arkari,
80 houses, 5 kôs, easy road (Sháli, 10 houses, is one kôs from Arkari);
Mōmi, 5 kôs farther on, 50 houses. From Arkari to Shoghor is 10 kôs
katcha. From Shoghor, 3 miles below, is Rondur, 5 or 6 houses; 4 kôs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_6_Page_10" id="Appendix_6_Page_10">[10]</a></span>
is another Shali, 20 houses, and thence over a plain by a village (the
name of which I forget) 5 katcha kôs.</p>

<p>Below Shoghor the streams of Arkari and Lodko join, at Andakhti, two
katcha kôs from Shoghor. The Rajah of Chitràl’s son lives there (Bahram);
another son, Murid, lived in Lodko district. There is little snowfall
on the high Khatinza, but there is plenty on the easy Nuqsán. A third
road, over a plain, also leads to Chitrál from Zeibák, namely, to Uskútul
(3 kôs from Zeibák); thence to Singlich, 2½ kôs, maidán; thence to the
great tank, lake, or Hauz, five miles long and 1½ miles broad, full of big fish.
Thence over the Durra, infested by Kafirs, only a katcha kôs, easy ascent,
when the snow melts (otherwise impassable), and an easy descent of one
kôs to Shai Sidèn, at foot of pass (below which is, 2 kôs, Gobôr, where there
is some cultivation in summer). (Birzin is a village of 40 houses, about 8 kôs
distant from Gobôr.) Parabêg, 50 houses, 2 kôs; Parabêg to Kui, 70 houses,
1 katcha kôs; below Kui, ½ kôs, is Jítur; below is a ziarat of Pir Shah Nasir
Khosrō at Birgunnì, one kôs, a warm spring, 50 houses; Birgunnì to Drôshp,
2 katcha kôs, where Raja Imán-ul-Mulk’s son, Murid, resides. Drôshp, 40
houses; one kôs further is Mogh, 20 houses; thence to Andákhti, 4 or 5
kôs. Over the Hauz is the Mandàl mountain towards the Siah Posh
country. Ahmad Diwanè, 50 houses, is the first village of Kafirs, subject
to Chitrál. Over Gabôr is the Shuitsh Mountain, behind which is the
Aptzai Fort of the Siah Posh Kafirs, 200 houses; these are the two places
from which Kafirs descend to plunder caravans coming from Peshawar, and
of whose approach they may have been warned from Chitrál, keeping
clothes and weapons for themselves, and giving the horses, etc., to Chitrál.
The Kafirs of Kamōz (2,000 houses) are subject to Chitrál; also Ludde
(1,000 houses), Aptsai (200 houses), Shudgol Fort (150 houses).</p>

<p>Istagàz is subject (100 houses) to Chitrál; Mēr (40 houses) subject to
Chitrál; Mundjèsh, 500 houses; Madugàll (500 houses and two forts), on
a difficult road, is between Kamōz (1 kôs above it) and Kamtán (Ludde,
Aptsai, Shudgol, Ahmad Diwané), 4 kôs. These Madugallis are independent,
and plunder caravans from Dīr or Zemindars. Sometimes they are
bribed by the Chitrál Raja to keep quiet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Dull as the above account may read, it is full of topographical, if not
political, interest to whoever can read “between the lines”; and the telegrams
and articles in <i>The Times</i> of the 23rd and 25th Sept., 1891, throw
light on an unpleasant and hitherto concealed situation. Since 1866 I
have, in vain, drawn the attention of the Indian Government to the Gilgit
frontier. In 1886, or twenty years after my exploration, Colonel Lockhart’s
mission, no doubt, did service, as regards Chitrál; but Hunza and
Nagyr have been mismanaged, owing to the incompetent manner in which
my information has been used. I have recently, after three years’ labour,
much expense, and some danger, completed the first quarto volume of my
work on Hunza, Nagyr, and a part of Yasin, the language of which has been
a great puzzle, that has now been unravelled, giving a new departure to
philology; and the Foreign Department of the Indian Government has presented
me with 100 copies of my work, a compliment that is often paid to
the honorary contributor of a paper to the <span class="smcap">Asiatic Quarterly Review</span>.</p>

<h3 id="APPENDIX_VII">APPENDIX VII.</h3>

<h4 id="APPENDIX_VII_a">(a) A SECRET RELIGION IN THE HINDUKUSH [THE PAMIR REGION] AND IN THE LEBANON.</h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">I.—The Muláis of the Hindukush.</span></h5>

<p>A number of conjectures as to the origin of the word
“Mulái,” all of which are incorrect, have been made by
eminent writers unacquainted with Arabic or the meaning
of its theological history and terms. A few of these conjectures,
however, go very near some fact or view connected
with the “Muláis.” The word may not mean “terrestrial
gods,” but there are no other, for practical purposes, in the
creed of the “Muláis.” It is certainly not a corruption of
“Muláhid” or “heretic,” if not “atheist,” although this
term has been specially applied to them by their enemies.
It can have nothing whatever to do etymologically with
“Muwáhidin” or worshippers of “One” [God], though
they, no doubt, call themselves so, <i>i.e.</i>, “Unitarians.” There
is this additional difficulty, moreover, introduced into the
question, that no name can be conclusive as to the esoteric
appellation of a sect that has been obliged to practise
“Conformity” or “Pious fraud” or “concealment” of
its religion, in order to escape persecution or wholesale
massacre. The Shiahs,<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> whose belief, in the hereditary
succession, through the descendants of A’li, of the <i>spiritual</i>
“Imámat” or leadership or apostleship of the prophet
Muhammad, rendered them overt or covert enemies of those
Sunni rulers who held the <i>temporal</i> power or “the Khiláfat”
(misspelt as “the Caliphate”), were, and are, allowed to
practise “Taqqîa” (which I have rendered as “Conformity”)
outwardly and the more exaggerated or exclusive a
particular A’liite or Shiite sect, the more careful had it to
be. The Sunni and Shiah may both publicly confess “There
is no God but God, and Muhammad is his prophet”; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_2" id="Appendix_7_Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the Shiah adds under his breath, “A’li is the Deputy
(Governor) of God and the heir of the prophet of God.”
Now this word for “Deputy” is “<i>vali</i>,” “to be close to,”
whether it be to God, a king, a priest, a master, or other
position of eminence in Arabian belief, society, history, or
intellectual creations.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> “Maulá” or “Mulá” comes from
the same root and is generally applied to a spiritual master,
but, among the Shiahs, specially to their “<span class="smcap">Lord</span>” A’li.
Therefore, “Muláis” are the special followers of the
“Lord A’li,” just as the Jesuits claim to be a fraternity of
special followers of “the Lord Jesus.” When, then, the
term “Mauláná” or our “Master or Lord” is specially used
in the Druse Covenant of Initiation [see further on], there
is not far to seek for the meaning of the appellation
“Mulái,” though it was left for me to find it out from the
A’liite songs of the Muláis of the Hindukush. Whatever
the innermost coterie of the “initiated” may practise or
believe, a connecting link of the sect with some existing
creed is necessary for their safety or respectability. Thus,
the <i>Ismailians</i> might call themselves “<i>Sadiqis</i>” or “the
righteous,” in order to spread the belief of their being
special adherents of the 6th Imám, (in the order of descent
from A’li), the Imám Ja’far <i>Sádiq</i> (the righteous), without
entering into the vexed question as to whether his son
“<i>Ismàîl</i>” was the real “seventh” Imám or his other son,
Mûsa (through whom the bulk of Shiahs look for their
Mahdi or Messiah, the 12th Imám). Nor would any such
special fervour in revering a particular phase or man be
necessarily deemed to be heretical, even among Sunnis.
I have often heard a Sunni, especially if he was a Persian
scholar and the strange magic of that language had subdued
him, admit the impeachment of having “a particular love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_3" id="Appendix_7_Page_3">[3]</a></span>
for the house of A’li,” and the numerous class of Sayads, who
claim to be descendants of the Prophet, is respected, if
not venerated, among Sunnis, who, in theory, oppose the
“hereditary” claims of Shiahs.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The Máulais, therefore,
of the Hindukush, being, consciously or not, a sub-sect of
Shiahs, can make friends with the main body of Shiahs,
and yet pretend to the Sunnis as being, in many respects,
with them. Normally, the Mauláis would profess to be good
Muhammadans of the Shiah persuasion, leaning, however,
to the 7th Imám; if surrounded by, or in danger of, Sunnis,
they would <i>outwardly</i> “conform” (which is all that the
Sunnis require), and, at home, practise their own rites. The
Khojas of Bombay, who had been converted from Hinduism,
but whose very name is Ismailian, used to read the “Das-awtar”
or “ten incarnations,” in which “A’li” is made out
to be the “Tenth Incarnation,” thus rendering their step
from Wishnu Hinduism to Shiah Muhammadanism an easy
one. “All things to all men” is the dictum of the
Muláis, without, thereby, sacrificing their own convictions.
The more a Mulái knows, the more he acts on
Disraeli’s sneer that all sensible men are of <i>one</i> religion,
but do not tell what that religion is. The less a Mulái
knows, the more fanatically is he an A’liite, centreing
however his faith on the living descendant of the 7th Imám.
“Nothing is a crime that is not found out” may, or may
not be, the theory among the Druses, or the practice all
over the world; the fact remains that neither the Druses
nor the Muláis, whatever their belief, are worse than their
neighbours. Even the odious signification that attaches
to the term “Assassin” has been a calumny against those
misguided Ismailians who sought to rid the world of tyrants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_4" id="Appendix_7_Page_4">[4]</a></span>
who had ordered the general massacre of the sect or who
sacrificed one man in order to save a whole people.</p>

<p>In 1866 I discovered the languages and races of “Dardistan”
and gave that name to the countries between
Kashmir and Kabul, including Hunza in them. In 1886 I
was again on a special mission regarding the language of
Hunza-Nagyr and a part of Yasin. I had already pointed
out in 1867 the importance which our good friend, His
Highness Agha Khan of Bombay, the Head of the Khojas
in that city, enjoyed in those, then nearly inaccessible,
regions, as also in Wakhan, Zebak, Shignán, Raushan,
Koláb and Derwáz, where the Muláis predominate and are
governed by hereditary Pîrs or ancient sages of their own
choice,<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> to whom they yield implicit obedience, as do also the
covenanters with “Al-Hákim” among the “initiated” of the
Druses. Of these Pîrs, Agha Khan is Chief, and any command
by him would be obeyed in some of the most dangerous
parts of the Hindukush. Advantage was only taken
in 1886 of this hint, when Colonel Lockhart’s mission was
supplied with letters of recommendation by His Highness
to the Mulais. My identification of their mysterious rites
with those of the Druses connects the Lebanon with the
Hindukush through the Ismailia sect, which under the
name of the “Assassins” enjoyed such an unenviable
notoriety during the Crusades and establishes a link
among the nations of Richard Cœur de Lion,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> of Palestine
and of the Pamirs. The connection of Hunza with the
Huns or Hunas and the relations between the “Old Man
of the Mountain” and our own Richard may be the subject
of a future article. At present, I will confine myself to
translating from the Persian original a Pythian utterance
out of the “Kelám-i-Pîr” or “the Word of the ancient
Sage,” which takes the place of the Korán among Mauláis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_5" id="Appendix_7_Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and of which the following is the first extract ever given
from that hidden book. It was partly dictated to me
and partly written out on the occasion of His Highness,
the present Agha Khan, paying me a visit, by the leader
of some Muláis, who had fled, first from Russian tyranny,
and then from the still heavier Afghan oppression in the
border-countries of Central Asia, my own Hunza man
also being present on the occasion.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The extract was
called the Mulái “Mukti” or “Salvation” Cry of the
Muláis. It may be incidentally mentioned that Shah
Abdurrahim in Zeibak was (and perhaps still is) the
greatest Pîr in Central Asia. He controls Hunza, so far
as that God-forsaken country can be controlled. In
Wakhan, Khwaja Ibrahim Husain was the Mulái leader,
and in Sarikul, Shahzada Makin. Sayad Jafar Khan ruled
what there is of the sect in Bokhara, Balkh, Kabul and
Kunduz. “<i>The</i> Pîr” or “ancient sage,” however, was
the historical Shah Nasir Khosrô, who is styled “a missionary
of H. H. Aga Khan’s ancestor.” He is said to
have had the complete “Kelám-i-Pîr,” a book of which I
have for so many years in vain tried to get a copy, although
assisted by my friend, the Mihtar Nizám-ul-Mulk of Yasin
and Chitrál. The following extract from it, in one and the
same breath, affirms and denies the special doctrine of
metempsychosis and other notions opposed to the professed
Muhammadanism of the Muláis:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <span class="smcap">Mukti</span> or “<span class="smcap">Salvation</span>.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Mulái “<span class="smcap">A’qil</span>” or “intelligent” = “initiated” [the
singular of the Druse “U’qalá” or “initiated”] first asks,
in inelegant and enigmatical Persian:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“<span class="smcap">Ala!</span> In what I say, can I remain <i>knowingly</i> an
Á’qil?” or “initiated” or “I remain knowingly an Á’qil,

<p>2. “If, <i>knowingly</i>, that secret, come and tell me: ‘Light’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Al Láy!</span> Helper of Chosroes!<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Such secrets to
men why recklessly impart? [it only makes them impudent]
Not will say ever this the <i>A’qil</i> [or “the initiated one.”]</p>

<p>[The wise do not mention their religion; if they do, they
only make the unwise impudent.]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So, after all, we have not been told the process or secret
of after-life, whether ascending into air, descending into
earth, renewing human life or migrating into animal, plant
or stone. In fact, we are made to understand that our
inquiry is folly and that its answer, whether true or not, is
also folly. Yet are we allowed to conjecture the belief of
“the initiated” in transmigration.</p>

<p>As for the Muláis “being all things to all men” in
matters of religion—Sunnis with Sunnis and Shiahs with
Shiahs—this is, as already stated, a mere amplification of
the Shiah doctrine of <i>Taqqîah</i> or concealment in times of
danger, to which I have specially referred in my “Dardistan.”</p>

<p>The leaning of the Muláis is, of course, rather to poetical
Shiism, with the chivalrous martyr A’li as its demigod or
“next to God” in the A’lewia sect, than to prosaic and
monotonous Sunniism, so that to strangers they seem to be
Shiahs, as will be seen in an extract from a native Indian
Diary<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> written some 20 years ago, and which, it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_8" id="Appendix_7_Page_8">[8]</a></span>
incidentally stated, still throws much light on the present
conflicts in Dir, Bajaur and other petty States bordering
on our frontier. No stranger is allowed to see the Kelám-i-Pir,
which takes the place of the Koran with Muláis, but
in the most popular poem that is recited by them, the
Imám-ul Zemán or Sahib-al-Zeman = the Imam or Lord of
the Age (H. H. Aga Khan) is worshipped as the Monarch
of this World, the visible incarnation of the Deity, offerings
or a pilgrimage to whom dispenses a Mulái from prayer,
fasting or a visit to the sacred shrines of Mecca or Madina,
or rather the Shiah Kerbelá, the place of the martyrdom of
Hasan and Husain, which Shiahs annually celebrate by
what are inappropriately called “miracle plays,” but which
really are “elegies,” and commemorative funeral recitations
and processions. A person who has seen “the Lord of
the Age” or who possesses some of the water in which he
has washed his feet is an honoured guest in Mulái countries.
The poem above alluded to is a parallel to the Druse
“Contract” which will be considered further on, and begins
with an invocation for “Help, oh Ali.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Nobody will worship God, without worshipping Thee, Lord of the Age!</div>
<div class="verse">Jesus will descend from the fourth heaven to follow Thee, Lord of the Age!</div>
<div class="verse">Thy will alone will end the strife with Antichrist, Lord of the Age!</div>
<div class="verse">Thy beauty gives light to heaven, the sun and the moon, Lord of the Age!</div>
<div class="verse">May I be blessed by being under the dust of Thy feet, Lord of the Age!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A Maulái is, if sincere, already dead to sin, and can,
therefore, not commit any. He needs, therefore, no resurrection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_9" id="Appendix_7_Page_9">[9]</a></span>
or last Judgment day. Obedience to the Pîr is his
sole article of faith, and he holds his property, family and
life at this Chief’s disposal.</p>

<p>I must now conclude this introduction to a comparison of
the creeds of the Druses and of the Muláis by quoting a
few words from a rhapsody of A’li, repeated by the ordinary
Mauláis till the pious frenzy is at white heat:</p>

<p>“Oh A’li, to God, to God, oh A’li, my sole aim, the only
one, our Mula A’li; My desire, the only our Mula A’li; My
passion only the beauty of A’li; My longing day and night
for union with A’li; Higher and Higher A’li, oh A’li; A’li
is the Killer of difficulties, oh A’li; He is the Commander
of the Faithful, namely A’li; <i>That</i> one is the Imám of the
steadfast in faith, namely A’li,” and so on <i>ad infinitum</i> till
we come to the natural connection between normal Shiism,
its exaggeration into A’li worship, its mysterious interpretation
of the self-sacrifice of Husain to save the world,
and, finally, to all other aberrations of which Maulaism is
one. The poem then goes into wild Turkish and Arabic
measures, which exhausted my informant, Ghulam Haidar,
who adds on behalf of himself, also in verse: “It is not
proper that I should not answer the question which you
ask me, but what am I to say? The answer from me is
easy, but I see a difficulty in <i>your</i> way. Oh Ghulam
Haidar” (thrice repeated). Then in prose. “In the night
of Friday, the Mulái men (in Hunza), instead of worship
and prayer, taking Guitars and Drums (Rabábs and
Ḍaffs) in their hands, play the above “Ghazals” on them.
Then six old men, Akhunds (priests), having assembled,
read (sing) them in the Mosque, when the men of the
mass of the people gather and give ear to them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘“Yá A’li, Yá A’li, Yá Imám-i-Zemán”’—</div>
<div class="verse">‘“Oh Ali, Oh Ali, Oh Imám (and Lord) of the Age”’—</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>is the mention (Chorus) which they take on their tongues.
From the beginning of the evening till the morning they
thus show their zeal; the Raja then as a reward of thanks
for that worship bestows (gold dust to the value of) four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_10" id="Appendix_7_Page_10">[10]</a></span>
tilas on the priests and gives them a quantity of butter of
the weight of four measures and one sheep or big calf and
one maund of wheat in order to hold a feast.”</p>

<h5>II.—<span class="smcap">The Covenant of “the initiated” Druses.</span></h5>

<p>The following is a rendering of the Covenant or Contract
which the U’qalá or “the initiated” amongst the Druses are
reciting in mysterious seclusion. It was overheard by my
informant, an “uninitiated” Druse.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> It formed, as it were,
the evening prayer of his uncle and aunt. Although an
educated and highly intelligent person, he was not aware
of even its local interest, much less of its general historical
and religious importance.</p>

<h6><i>The Covenant = Al Mitháq</i>:</h6>

<p>“O Governor [Valî] of the Age,<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> may Allah’s blessing and
peace be upon him” (this phrase seems intended to delude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_11" id="Appendix_7_Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Muhammadans into the belief that the Druses have the
same Allah or God, but it has an esoteric sense which
will become apparent further on). “I put my confidence
into ‘our spiritual head the Lord’ (literally ‘<span class="smcap">our Maula
Al-Hákim</span>’) (here is one of the esoteric formulæ)—‘the
One, the Single, the Everlasting (Lord), the (serenely)
Distinct from Duality and Number.’ (This is a protest not
only against the female form of the Deity, but also against
the notion of a distinct good and evil principle, an Ahriman
or Ormuz, whilst its Muhammadan form would seem to outsiders
to be merely a protest against giving any ‘companion
to God.’) The initiator and the to be ‘initiated’ then go on
repeating together the following, the former using the 3rd,
and the latter the 1st, person. ‘I so and so’ (here comes
name of the initiated), ‘son of such a one, <span class="smcap">confess</span> firmly
the confession to which he (or I) respond from his [or my]
soul, and bears testimony to it upon his spirit, whilst in a condition
of soundness of his spirit and of his body, and with
the (acceptance of the passing of the) lawfulness of the order,
obeying without reluctance and under no violence: <span class="smcap">that</span> he
verily absolves (himself) from all Religions and Dogmas and
Faiths and Convictions, all of them, in the various species of
their contradictions, and that he does not acknowledge anything
except the <span class="smcap">obedience to our Maula Al-Hákim</span>, may
his mention be glorious! and this obedience it is the worship,
and that he will not associate in his worship any (other)
that is past or is present, or is to come, and that he has
verily entrusted his spirit and his body, and whatever is to
him and the whole of what he may possess to <span class="smcap">our Maula
Al-Hákim</span>, and that he is satisfied to fulfil all His orders
unto himself and against himself without any contradiction,
and not refusing anything and not denying (refusing)
anything of His actions, whether this injures him or rejoices
him, and that he, should he ever revert (apostatize)
from the religion of our Maula Al-Hákim which he has
written upon his soul, and to which he has born testimony
unto his spirit, that <span class="smcap">he shall be bereft</span> (free) of the Creator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_12" id="Appendix_7_Page_12">[12]</a></span>
who is worshipped and deprived of the benefits of all the
sanctions (rules, laws), and that he shall be considered as
deserving the punishment of God, the High, may His
mention be glorious! And that he, if he acknowledges
that there is not to him in Heaven and not in the Earth an
Imám in existence <i>except our Maula Al-Hákim</i>” (this confession
distinguishes the Druses of the Lebanon and the
Muláis of the Hindukush from the orthodox Shiahs, who
believe in the coming of the ever-present Mahdi, or the
twelfth Imám, a view that had been fostered by us in the
Sudán to our endless confusion by our inexcusable opposition
to the Sultan of Turkey as the Khalifa of the Sunnis), “then
will the mention of him (who only believes in Al-Hákim)
become glorious, and he will be of the <i>Muwáhidîn</i> (who
profess the unity of God), who will (eventually) conquer.”
(This appellation is common to the Druses and to the Muláis,
but is not admitted as being applicable to them by orthodox
Shiahs or Sunnis. In retaliation they call the Sunni a dog,
and the Shiah an ass.) “And (the above) has been written<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
in the month so and so of the year (chronology) of the I’d
(festival) of our Maula Al-Hákim, whose nation be glorious,
whose Empire be strengthened to Him alone.” (The
Maulái Chronology is said to begin with the <i>special</i> revelation
of the Imám on the 17th Ramadan in the 559th
year of the Hejira, at the castle of Alamût.)</p>

<h6><i>The Special Recitation.</i></h6>

<p>The following is repeated by Druses at the conclusion
of their prayers: “May God’s blessing be upon him who
speaks (confesses) the Lord of goodness and benefits. May
God bless the Ruler of the Guidances (Hidāyā); to him be
profit and sufficiency. May God’s blessing be on our Lord
the Hādi” (the Guide or “Mehdi” means one who is guided
aright by God = the coming Messiah of the Shiah world,)
“the Imám, the greatest of the perfect light” (this is an
allusion to the 7th Imám, Ismail, descendant of <i>the</i> light<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_13" id="Appendix_7_Page_13">[13]</a></span>
(Mohammed)), “who is waiting for the refuge (salvation) of
all living beings. On Him may be (our) trust, and from
him (may be) the peace. May God bless him and them
whatever passes of nights and of days and of months and
of years, whenever flashes the dawn of morning or night
remains in darkness may abundant peace and trust be for
ever! <i>O Allah-humma!</i>” (the mystic Muhammadan remnant
of Elohim = Lords, Gods) “provide us with <i>Thy</i> contentment”
(this is a play of words implying that our best “daily
bread” is God’s contentment with us) “and with <i>Their</i>
contentment” (this is either a Trinitarian or Polytheistic
invocation to “Elohim”) “and with <i>their</i> intercession and
with <i>Thy</i> mercy and with <i>their</i> mercy in this world and in
the next! O our Maula! and Lord of the Imám” (this is
indeed significant as to the pretensions of Al-Hákim to
the godhead, or to some dignity very near it).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now comes an ancient curse with a modern application
and an appeal to arms (whispered along the line of
assembled Druses):</p>

<p>“Pray for the ornament of sons,</p>

<p>In the East the five<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> residing (compare also the Shiah
‘Panjtan’<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and the five main Shiah sects)<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_14" id="Appendix_7_Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>They say: Father Abraham has appeared,</p>

<p>and they announce the good tidings to the worshippers of
<i>One</i> (the Druses).</p>

<p>They say: With the sword has Father Abraham appeared;</p>

<p>A violence to his enemies</p>

<p>O brethren! Prepare earnestly for the campaign,</p>

<p>Visiting the House of Mecca.</p>

<p>The House of Mecca and the sacred places,</p>

<p>Oh people of the Berbers! Extermination is lawful.</p>

<p>With the sword shall ye be sacrificed.</p>

<p>The French are coming with stealth.</p>

<p>Rejoice, people of China, in the hour of Thy arrival.</p>

<p>Welcome to thee, city of Arin (?), oh my Lady!” [Fatima?].</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A Druse wedding-song may also be quoted here:
(“Allah, billáli, billáli.”) <i>The Chorus</i>: “O God, with the
pearls, with the pearls,” “Sway on to me, oh my Gazelle!”
<i>Song</i>: “Thou maid who combest her (the bride’s) tresses,
comb them gently, and give her no pain; for she is the
daughter of nobles, accustomed to being a pet” [<i>delláli</i>].
<i>Chorus</i>: <i>Allah, billáli, billáli; wa tanaqqalí, yá Ghazáli!</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Another Song</i>: “Sing the praises of the shore, oh
daughters; sing the praises of the daughters of the shore;
for we have passed by the pomegranate-tree bearing full
fruit, and we have compared it with the cheeks of the
daughters of the shore.”</p>

<h4 id="APPENDIX_VII_b">(b) THE KELÁM-I-PÎR AND ESOTERIC MUHAMMADANISM.</h4>

<p>It is not my wish to satisfy idle curiosity by describing the
contents of a book, concealed for nine hundred years, the
greater portion of which accident has placed in my hands
after years of unsuccessful search in inhospitable regions.
The fragmentary information regarding it and the practices
of its followers which I had collected, were contributed to
publications, like this Review, of specialists for specialists
or for genuine Students of Oriental learning. Nothing
could be more distressing to me than the formation of a
band of “esoteric Muhammadans,” unacquainted with
Arabic, which is the only key to the knowledge of Islám.
The mastery of the original language of his holy Scripture
is, still more emphatically, the <i>sine quâ non</i> condition of a
teacher, be he Christian, Muhammadan, or other “possessor
of a sacred book.” Nor should anyone discuss another’s
faith without knowing its religious texts in the original as
well as its present practice.</p>

<p>The term “esoteric” has been so misused in connection
with Buddhism, the least mystic of religions, by persons
unacquainted with Sanscrit, Pali and modern Buddhism, that
it has become unsafe to adopt it as describing the “inner”
meaning of any faith. Were Buddha alive, he would
regret having made the path of salvation so easy by abolishing
the various stages of Brahminical preparation, through
a studious, practical and useful life, for the final retirement,
meditation, and Nirvana. Yet there are mysterious practices
in the Tantric worship of “the Wisdom of the Knowable,”
which Buddha alone brought to the masses that were to
be emancipated from the Brahminical yoke. Even transparent
Judaism has its Kabala, and the religion that brought
God to Man has mysteries of grace and godliness, the real
meaning of which is only known to the true Christian of
one’s own sect or school. Thus open, easy and simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_16" id="Appendix_7_Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Muhammadanism has its two triumphant orthodoxies of
Sunnis and Imamîa Shiahs and 72 militant, or outwardly
conforming, heterodoxies. Indeed, as long as words can
be fought over, and even facts do not impress all alike, so
long will the more or less proficient professors of a creed
reach various degrees of “esoteric” knowledge.</p>

<p>It is the unknown merit of the religious system of the
so-called Assassins of the Crusades to have discussed, dismissed
and yet absorbed a number of faiths and philosophies.
It adapted itself to various stages of knowledge among its
proselytes from various creeds, whilst the circumstances of
its birth, history and surroundings gave it a Muhammadan
basis. <i>Non omnia scimus omnes</i> may be said by the most
“initiated” Druse, Ismailian or “Mulái,” the latter being
the name by which I will, in future, designate all the
ramifications of this remarkable system of Philosophy,
Religion and Practical politics.</p>

<p>This system elaborates the principle that all truths, except
<span class="smcap">one</span>, are relative. It treats each man as it finds him, leading
him through stages, complete in themselves, to the final
secret. We, too, in a way admit that strong meat and drink
are not the proper food for babes. We speak of professional
training and of the professional spirit, of <i>esprit de corps</i>,
terms which all have an “esoteric” sense, and imply preparation;
indeed, every experience of life is an “initiation”
which he, who has not undergone it, cannot “realize;” we,
too, have medical and other works which the ordinary
reader does not buy and which are, so far, “esoteric” to
him, but we have not laid down in practice that he, who
does not know, shall not teach or rule. This has been
systematized, with a keen sense of proportion, by the
Founders of the Ismailian sect. Fighting for its existence
against rival Muhammadan bodies and in the conflicts of
Christianity, Judaism, Magianism and various Philosophies,
its emissaries applied the Pauline conduct of being “all
things to all men” in order to gain converts.</p>

<p>After the establishment of mutual confidence, a Christian
might be confronted with puzzling questions regarding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_17" id="Appendix_7_Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Trinity, the Atonement, the Holy Communion, etc.—the
Jew be called to explain an Universal God, yet exclusively
beneficent to His people, or might be cross-examined on
the miracles of Moses; a Zoroastrian, to whom much
sympathy should be expressed, would be sounded as to his
Magian belief; an idolater, if ignorant, could be easily
shown the error of his ways and, if not, his pantheism
might be checked by the evidences of materialistic or
monotheistic doctrine; the orthodox Sunni would be required
to explain the apparent inconsistencies of statements
in the Korán, and the various sects of Shiahs would be
confounded by doubts being thrown on this or that link of
the hereditary succession of the apostleship of Muhammad;
sceptics, philosophers, word-splitters, both orthodox and
heterodox, would be followed into their last retrenchments
by contradictory arguments, materialistic, idealistic, exegetical,
as the case may be. With every creed, to use an
Indian simile, the peeling of the onion was repeated, in
which, after one leaf after the other of the onion is taken
off in search of the onion, no onion is found and nothing is
left. The enquirer would thus be ready for the reception of
such new doctrine as might be taught him by the “Mulái”<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
preacher, or <i>Dái</i>, who then revealed himself one step beyond
the mental and moral capacity of his intended convert,
whilst sharing with the latter a basis of common belief.
Now this required ability of no mean order, as also of great
variety, so as to be adapted to all conditions of men to
whom the <i>Dái</i> might address himself. Sex, age, profession,
heredity and acquired qualities, antecedents and
attainments, all were taken into consideration. At the
same time, in an age of violence, the missionaries of the
new faith had to keep their work a profound secret and to
insist on a covenant, identical with, or similar to, the one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_18" id="Appendix_7_Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the Druses, which I published in the last number of the
<i>Asiatic Quarterly Review</i>. Even when confronted by
Hinduism, the new creed could represent that Áli, the son-in-law
of the prophet Muhammad, was the 10th incarnation
of Vishnu, which is expected, as was the Paraclete and as
are the Messiah and the “Mehdi” (many of those who
adopted that title being secret followers of the Ismailian
creed).<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> I have pointed out in my last article how the
very name of ’Ali, his chivalrous character, his eloquence,
his sad death and the martyrdom of his sons lent themselves
to his more than apotheosis in minds already prepared by
Magian doctrine and the spirit of opposition to the successful
Sunni oppressor. I think that I can quote extracts, in support
of this statement from the “Kelám-i-pîr” or the “<i>Logos</i> of
the Ancient,” showing how the contributor to it (for I take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_19" id="Appendix_7_Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the “Kelám-i-pîr” to be a collective name like “Homer”),
the eminent mathematician, historian and poet, Shah Násir
Khosrû, who was born in the year 355 <span class="smcapuc">A.H.</span> = 969 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> was
led, after a long life of purity and piety, of abstemiousness
and study, to examine and reject one religion after the
other and, finally, adopt the one with which we are now
concerned and of which His Highness, Agha Sultan
Muhammad Shah is the present hereditary spiritual head.
His authority extends from the Lebanon to the Hindukush
and wherever else there may be Ismailians, who either
openly profess obedience to him, as do the Khojahs in
Bombay; or who are his secret followers in various parts of
the Muhammadan world in Asia and Africa.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_20" id="Appendix_7_Page_20">[20]</a></span>
young, but enlightened, Chief is, as his father and grandfather,
likely to exert his influence for good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_21" id="Appendix_7_Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The following is a short biographical sketch of this
lineal descendant of the prophet Áli. His genealogy is
incontestable and will, I hope, be included in my next
paper.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>“H. H. Agha Sultan Muhammad Shah was born at
Karachi on Nov. 2nd, 1877. It was soon seen that it would
be necessary to give him a good education, and his father,
H. H. the late Agha Ali Shah, early grounded him in the
history of Persia and the writings of its great poets. But
this education was certainly not sufficient in the present
day, and Lady Ali Shah, after the death of her husband,
very wisely carried out his wishes by placing his son under
an English tutor, so that, whilst Persian was by no means
neglected, a course of English reading was begun. Four
years ago he stumbled over the spelling of monosyllables.
The progress made now is really surprising; with natural
talents he has found it easy to acquire a thorough English
accent and converses freely with Englishmen. The histories
of Persia, India and England, the series of the Rulers
of India and the Queen’s Prime Ministers, McCarthy’s
‘History of our Own Times’ and the lives of eminent
men that stock his library, mark a predilection for
History and Biography. The subjects of conversation
during a morning’s ride are often the politics of the day or
the turning points in the lives of illustrious men. But with
this reading his other studies are not neglected. Algebra,
Geometry, Arithmetic, elementary Astronomy, Chemistry
and Mechanics, with English authors like Shakespeare,
Macaulay, and Scott, form a part of his scholastic course.</p>

<p>“Unlike his father and grandfather, the Aga Sahib has little
love for hunting, though he is seen regularly on the racecourse
and is well known in India as a patron of the turf. In
the peculiarity of his position it will be difficult for him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_22" id="Appendix_7_Page_22">[22]</a></span>
travel for some years, but his eyes are directed to Europe
and he looks forward to the pleasure of witnessing at some
future time an important debate in the House of Commons.
From the fact that every mail brings English periodicals to
his door, it will be seen that he closely follows everything
that relates to English politics.</p>

<p>“With the work amongst the Khojahs and his other
followers devolving upon him at so early an age his
studies are, of course, liable to be interrupted, and it is
hardly possible for him to devote himself to his books—Oriental
and English—as much as he would wish to do.
He is not yet married, nor does he seem inclined to marry
early. A few years, however, must see him the father of a
family, and there is little doubt that his children will be
educated with all the advantages of the best ancient and
modern education so as to make them worthy of their
illustrious descent.”</p>

<p>How far His Highness will be himself initiated into more
than the practice and rites, public and private, of so much
of his form of the Ismailian Faith as is necessary for the
maintenance of his position and responsibilities towards his
followers, depends on his attainments, mental vigour, and
character. With greater theoretical power than even the
Pope, who is not hereditary, his influence is personal and
representative by the <i>consensus fidelium</i>. Nearly all of
them are in the first, or second, degree, even their Pirs
being generally in the 3rd or 4th, with a general leaning to a
mystic divine A’li, not merely the historical A’li, whom their
followers see incarnated in his present living descendant.
Few, if any, of the leaders are in higher degrees, for they
might be out of touch with the practical exigencies of their
position in different countries and circumstances. Perhaps,
among the Druses, there may be one professor in the
highest stage of the “initiated”—the Ninth—but even
then he would take his choice of Philosophies and find a
microcosm of theory and practice in each. The result on
mind and character would be ennobling, and he would die,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7_Page_23" id="Appendix_7_Page_23">[23]</a></span>
if, indeed, an “initiated” can die, carrying away with him
the secret of his faith, which he alone has been found
worthy to discover. What that secret is, no amount of
divulging will impart to any one who is not fit to receive it,
though the infinite variety of its manifestations adapt it to
every form of thought or life. That even Masonic passwords
may, for practical purposes and in spite of published
books, be kept a secret, though possibly an open one,
experience has shown, but the man does not yet exist who
can, or will, apply the system, of which I have endeavoured
to give a hint, to the Universal Federation of Religious
Autonomies, which, in my humble opinion, the Ismailian
doctrine was intended to found, little as its present followers
may know of this use of the genuine ring of Truth, of
which every religion, according to Lessing’s <i>Nathan der
Weise</i>, claims to have the exclusive possession. If this be
not enough, I will, at the outset, give the advice that the
old man in Lavengro with his dying breath gave to his
disciple as the reward of a life-long devotion to learn the
great secret—“<span class="smcap">Learn Arabic</span>”—as a variation on his
“Learn German.” There is no royal road to learning or
to salvation, and mental culture is impossible without the
synthesis which the study of Classical languages—Oriental
or European—still foster in this age of destructive analysis
and of that scepticism which does not seek to re-construct.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since writing above another accident has placed in my
hands an evidently ancient manuscript in Persian verse, on
the same or kindred subjects of Ismailian belief. The
manuscript is duodecimo, about 200 pages in extent, and is
written in exquisite miniature caligraphy. Its perusal may
affect my decision as to the manner of dealing with the
question, so far as the public is concerned; in the meanwhile,
I am still in search of the name of its author, and of
its date.</p>

<p>The time has long passed since grammar and its rules could
be treated in the way to which we were accustomed at
school. Vitality has now to be breathed into the dry bones of
conjugations and declensions, and no language can be taught,
even for mere practical purposes, without connecting custom and
history with so-called “rules.” The influences of climate and of
religion have to be considered, as well as the character of the
people, if we wish to obtain a real hold on the language of our
study. Do we desire to make language a speciality, the preparation
of acquiring early in life two dissimilar languages, one
analytic and the other synthetic, is absolutely necessary, because
if that is not done, we shall always be hampered by the difficulty
of dissociating the substance from the word which designates it.
The human mind is extremely limited, and amongst the limits
imposed upon it are those of, in early life, connecting an idea,
fact, or process, with certain words; and unless two languages, at
least, are learnt, and those two are as dissimilar as possible, one
is always, more or less, the slave of routine in the perception and
in the application of new facts and of new ideas, and in the adaptation
of any matter of either theoretical or practical importance.
It is a great advantage, for linguistic purposes, which are far
more practically important than may be generally believed, that
the study of the classical languages still holds the foremost place
in this country; because, however necessary scientific “observation”
may be, it cannot take the place of a cultured imagination.
The stimulus of illustration and comparison, which, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_8_Page_3" id="Appendix_8_Page_3">[3]</a></span>
historical sense of the terms, is an absolutely necessary primary
condition to mental advance, is derived from classical and literary
pursuits. The study of two very similar languages, however, is
not the same discipline to a beginner in linguistics; <i>e.g.</i>, to learn
French and Italian is not of the same value as French and
German, for the more dissimilar the languages the better.</p>

<p>Again, if you desire to elicit a language of which you know
nothing, from a savage who cannot explain it and who does not
understand your language, there are certain processes with which
some linguists, no doubt, are familiar, and others commend themselves
in practical experience; for instance, in pointing to an
object which you wish to have, say, a fruit which you want to
eat, you may not only obtain the name for it, but the gesture to
obtain it, if you are surrounded by several savages whose
language you do not know, may also induce one of the men to
order another to get it for you,—I suppose on the principle that
it is easy for one to command and for others to obey; but, be
that as it may, this course, to the attentive observer, first obtains
the name for the required thing and next elicits the imperative;
you hear something with a kind of inflection which, once heard,
cannot be mistaken for anything else than the imperative.
Further, the <i>reply</i> to the imperative would either elicit “yes,” or
“no,” or the indicative present. This process of inquiry does not
apply to all languages, but it applies to a great many; and the
attitude which you have to assume towards every language that
you know nothing about, in the midst of strangers who speak it,
is that, of course, of an entirely sympathetic student. You have,
indeed, to apply to language the dictum which Buddhist Lamas
apply to religion—never to think, much less to say, that your
own religion (in this case your own language) is the best; <i>i.e.</i>, the
form of expression in which you are in the habit of conveying
your thoughts, is one so perfectly conventional, though rational
in your case, that the greatest freedom from prejudice is as
essential a consideration as the wish to acquire the language of
others. In other words, in addition to the mere elementary
acquisition of knowledge, you have to cultivate a sympathetic
attitude; and here, again, is one of the proofs of a truth which
my experience has taught me, that, however great knowledge
may be, sympathy is greater, for sympathy enables us to fit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_8_Page_4" id="Appendix_8_Page_4">[4]</a></span>
key which is given by knowledge. Gestures also elicit a response
in dealing, for instance, with numerals, where we are facilitated
by the fingers of the hand. Of course, one is occasionally
stopped by a savage who cannot go, or is supposed not to be able
to go, beyond two, or beyond five.</p>

<p>I take it that in the majority of cases of that kind, a good
deal of our misconception with regard to the difficulty of
the inquiry lies in ourselves—that ideas of multitude
connected with the peculiar customs of the race that have
yet to be ascertained, are at the bottom of the inability of that
race to follow our numeration. For instance we go up to ten,
and in order to elicit a name for eleven, we say “one, ten;” if
the man laughs, change the order, and say “ten, one;” the
chances are that the savage will instinctively rejoin “ten <i>and</i>
one,” and we then get the conjunction. Putting the fingers of
both hands together may mean “multitude,” “alliance,” or
“enmity,” according as the customs of the race are interpreted
by that gesture.</p>

<p>I am reminded of this particular instance in my experience,
because I referred to it in a discussion on an admirable paper on the
Kafirs of the Hindukush by the eminent Dr. Bellew. If you do not
take custom along with a “rule,” and do not try to explain the
so-called rule by either historical events or some custom of the
race, you make language a matter entirely of memory, and as
memory is one of the faculties that suffers most from advancing
age, or from modes of living and various other circumstances,
the moment that memory is impaired your linguistic knowledge
must suffer—you, therefore, should make language a matter of
judgment and of associations. If you do not do that, however
great your linguistic knowledge or scholarship, you must
eventually fail in doing justice to the subject or to those with
whom you are dealing.</p>

<p>The same principle applies as much to a highly civilised
language like Arabic, one of the most important languages in
the way of expressing the multifarious processes of human
thought and action, as to the remnant of the pre-historic Hunza
language, which throws an unexpected light on the science of
language.</p>

<p>Let us first take Arabic and the misconceptions of it by Arabic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_8_Page_5" id="Appendix_8_Page_5">[5]</a></span>
scholars. In 1859 I pointed out before the College of Preceptors,
how it was necessary not only to discriminate between the
Chapters in the Koran delivered at Mecca, and those given at
Medina, but also to arrange the verses out of various Chapters
in their real sequence. I believe we are now advancing towards
a better understanding of this most remarkable book. But we
still find in its translation such passages, for instance, as, “when
in war women are captured, <i>take</i> those that are not married.”
The meaning is nothing so arbitrary. The expression for “take”
that we have there is <i>ankohu</i>—marry, <i>i.e.</i>, take in marriage or
<i>nikáh</i>, as no alliance can be formed with even a willing captive
taken in war, except through the process of <i>nikáh</i>, which is the
religious marriage contract. Again, we have the passage, “Kill
the infidels wherever you find them.” There again is shown the
want of sympathetic knowledge, which is distinct from the
knowledge of our translators who render “qatilu” by “kill,”
when it merely means “fight” and refers to an impending
engagement with enemies who were then attacking Muhammed’s
camp. Apart from accuracy of translation, a sympathetic
attitude is also of practical importance. <i>E.g.</i>, had we gone into
Oriental questions with more sympathy and, in consequence,
more real knowledge, many of our frontier wars would have
been avoided, and there is not the least doubt that in dealing
with Oriental humanity, whether we had taken a firm or a conciliatory
course, we should have been upon a track more likely
to lead to success than by taking action based on insufficient
knowledge or on preconceptions. For instance, in the <i>Times</i>
there was a telegram from Suakim about the Mahdi, to
the effect that El Senousi was opposing him successfully. I do
not know who El Senousi is, but very many years ago I pointed
out the great importance of the Senousi <i>sect</i> in Africa, and,
unless the deceased founder of that name has now arisen, whether
it is a man of that name or the now well-known sect that is
mentioned, one cannot say from the telegram. The sender of
the message states that as sure as the El Senousi rises to importance
there will be a danger to Egypt and to Islam. It is
Christian like to think well of Islam, and to try to protect it.
This very few Christians do, and it shows a kind feeling towards
a sister-faith, but I am not sure that the writer accurately knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_8_Page_6" id="Appendix_8_Page_6">[6]</a></span>
what Islam is; though there can be no doubt that the rise of
fanatical sects, like the Senousi, which is largely due to the feeling
of resistance created by the encroachments of so-called
European civilisation, is opposed to orthodox Muhammedanism.
Be that as it may, I have also turned to “the further correspondence
on the affairs of Egypt” which a friend gave me, and,
really, I now know rather less about Egypt than I did before.
For instance, I find (and I am specially referring to the blue-book
in my hand) that letters of the greatest importance from
the Mahdi are treated in the following flippant manner: “This is
nothing more or less than an unauthenticated copy of a letter sent
by the deceased Mahdi to General Gordon!” Is this not enough to
deserve attentive inquiry? General Gordon would, probably, not
have agreed with the writer of this contemptuous remark, which
is doubly out of place when we are also told that the Mahdi was
sending Gordon certain verses and passages from the Korán, illustrative
of his position, which are eliminated by the translator as
unnecessary, of no importance, and of very little interest! Now,
considering that this gentleman knew Arabic, I think I am
right when I add that with a little more sympathy he would
have known more, and had he known more he would have
quoted those passages, for it is most necessary for us to know
on what precise authority of the Korán or of tradition this so-called
Mahdi based his claim, and knowledge of this kind would
give us the opportunity of dealing with the matter. Again, on
the question of Her Majesty’s title of “Kaisar-i-hind,” which,
after great difficulty, I succeeded in carrying into general
adoption in India, the previous translators of “Empress” had
suggested some title which would either have been unintelligible
or which would have given Her Majesty a disrespectful appellation,
whilst none would have created that awe and respect
which, I suppose, the translation of the Imperial title was intended
to inspire. Even the subsequent official adopter of this
title, Sir W. Muir, advocated it on grounds which would have
rendered it inapplicable to India. With the National Anthem
similarly, we had a translation by a Persian into Hindustani,
which was supported by a number of Oriental scholars in this
country, who either did not study it, or who dealt with the
matter entirely from a theoretical point of view, and what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_8_Page_7" id="Appendix_8_Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the result? The result was—that for “God Save the Queen,” a
passage was put which was either blasphemous, or which, in
popular Muhammedan acceptance, might mean, “God grant that
Her Majesty may again marry!” whereas one of the glories of
Her Majesty among her Hindu subjects is that she is a true
“Satti” or Suttee, viz., a righteous widow, who ever honours
the memory of her terrestrial and spiritual husband—neither of
those views being intended by the translator, or by that very
large and responsible body of men who supported him, and that
still larger and emphatically loyal body that intended to give
the translation of the National Anthem as a gift to India at a
cost of several thousand pounds, when for a hundred rupees a
dozen accurate and respectful versions were elicited by me in
India itself.</p>

<p>I therefore submit that in speaking of the sciences of language
and ethnography, we have, or ought to have, passed, long ago,
the standpoint of treating them separately; they must be treated
together, and, as I said at the beginning, taking, <i>e.g.</i>, Arabic, with
its thirty-six broken plurals (quite enough to break anybody’s
memory), you will never be able to learn it unless you thoroughly
realise the life of the Arab, as he gets out of his tent in the
morning, milks his female camel, &amp;c., and unless you follow
him through his daily ride or occupations. Then you will
understand how it is, especially if you have travelled in Arabia,
that camels that appear at a distance on the horizon, affect the
eye differently from camels when they come near, and are seen
as they follow one another in a row, and those again different
from the camels as they gather round the tent or encampment;
and therefore it is that in the different perceptions to the eye,
under the influence of natural phenomena, these multifarious
plurals are of the greatest importance in examining the customs
of the people. Then will the discovery of the right plural be a
matter of enjoyment, leading one on to another discovery, and
to work all the better; whereas, with the grammatical routine
that we still pursue, I wonder, when we reach to middle or old
age, after following the literary profession, that we are not more
dull or confused than we are at present. When one abstract
idea follows the other, as in our phraseology, it is not like one
scene following another in a new country which is full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_8_Page_8" id="Appendix_8_Page_8">[8]</a></span>
stimulus, but the course which we adopt of abstract generalisations,
without analysing them and bringing them back to their
concrete constituents, is almost a process of stultification.</p>

<p>Coming now to one of the most primitive, and certainly one of
the remnants of pre-historic languages, that of Hunza, which I
had the opportunity of examining twenty-three years ago, while
Gilgit was in a state of warfare, and where I had to learn the
language, so to speak, with a pencil in one hand and a weapon
in the other, and surrounded by people who were waiting for an
opportunity to kill me, I found, that on reverting to it three
years ago, the language had already undergone a process of
assimilation to the surrounding dialects, owing to the advance of
so-called civilisation, which in that case, and which in the case of
most of these tribes, means the introduction of drunkenness and
disease, in this instance of cholera, for we know what has been
the condition of those countries which lie in the triangle between
Cashmere, Kabul, and Badakhshan, and to which I first
gave the name of Dardistan in 1866.</p>

<p>Now, what does this language show us? There the ordinary
methods proved entirely at fault. If one pointed to an object,
quite apart from the ordinary difficulties of misapprehension, the
man appealed to, for instance, might say “your finger,” if a
finger were the thing of which he thought you wanted the
name. If not satisfied with the name given in response, and
you turned to somebody else, another name was obtained; and
if you turned to a third person, you got a third name.</p>

<p>What was the reason for these differences? It was this, that
the language had not emerged from the state in which it is
impossible to have such a word as “head,” as distinguished from
“my head,” or “thy head,” or “his head”; for instance, <i>ak</i> is “my
name,” and <i>ik</i> is “his name.” Take away the pronominal sign,
and you are left with <i>k</i>, which means nothing. <i>Aus</i> is “my
wife,” and <i>gus</i> “thy wife.” The <i>s</i> alone has no meaning, and, in
some cases, it seemed impossible to arrive at putting anything down
correctly; but so it is in the initial stage of a language. In the
Hunza language under discussion, that stage is important to us as
members of the Aryan group, as the dissociation of the pronoun,
verb, adverb and conjunction from the act or substance only
occurs when the language emerges beyond the stage when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_8_Page_9" id="Appendix_8_Page_9">[9]</a></span>
groping, as it were, of the human child between the <i>meum</i> and
<i>tuum</i>, the first and second persons, approaches the clear perception
of the outer world, the “<i>suum</i>,” the third person. Now, during the
twenty years referred to “his” (house), “his” (name), and “his”
(head) are beginning to take the place of “house,” “name,”
“head,” generally, in not quite a decided manner, but still they
are taking their place. When I subsequently talked to the
Hunzas, and tried to find a reason for that “idiom,” if one may
use the term, it seemed very clear and convincing when they said,
“How is it possible for ‘a wife’ to exist unless she is somebody’s
wife?” “You cannot say, for instance, if you dissociate the one
from the other, ‘her wife,’ or ‘his husband.’ ‘Head,’ by itself,
does not exist; it must be somebody’s head.” When, again, you
dissociate the sound which stands for the action or substance
from the pronoun, you come, in a certain group of words, to another
range of thought connected with the primary family
relation, and showing the existence of that particularly ancient
form of endogamy, in which all the elder females are the mothers
and all the elder men are the fathers of the tribe. For instance,
take a word like “mother;” “m” would mean the female
principle, “o” would be the self, and the <i>ther</i> would mean “the
tribe;” in other words, “mother” would mean: “the female
that bore me and that belongs to my tribe.” Now, fanciful as
this may appear to us, it is the simple fact as regards the Hunza
language, which, when put the test of analysis, will throw an
incredible light on the history of Aryan words. For instance,
taking Sanskrit as a typical language, you will, I believe, find how
the early relations grew, and you will get beyond the root into
the parts of which the root is made up; each of which has a
meaning, not in one or two instances, but in most. I am not
going to read you the volume which I am preparing for the
Indian Government, and which is only the first part of the
analysis with regard to this language, and only a very small
portion indeed of the material that I collected in 1866, 1872, and
1884 regarding that important part of the world, Dardistan,
which is now being drawn within the range of practical Indian
politics—a region situated between the Hindukush and Kaghan
(lat. 37° N. and long. 73° E. to lat. 35° N. and long. 74·3° E.)
and comprising monarchies and republics, including a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_8_Page_10" id="Appendix_8_Page_10">[10]</a></span>
republic of eleven houses—a region which contains the solution
of numerous linguistic and ethnographical problems, the cradle of
the Aryan race, inhabited by the most varied tribes, from which
region I brought the first Hunza and the first Káfir that ever
visited England, and of which region one of its bigger Chiefs,
owing to my sympathy with the people, invested me with a kind
of titular governorship. In that comparatively small area the
questions that are to be solved are great, and it is even now in
some parts, perhaps, as hazardous a journey as, say, through the
dark continent. Whether you get to the ancient Robber’s Seat
of Hunza, where the right of plundering is hereditary, or into
the recesses of Kafiristan or the fastnesses of Pakhtu settlers;
whether you proceed to the republics of Darel, Tangir or Chilás,
or proceed to the community where women are sometimes at the
head of affairs, and which is neither worse nor better than others,
an amount of information, especially ethnographic, is within
one’s reach which makes Dardistan a region that would reward
a number of explorers. I may say, in my own instance, if my
life is spared for ten years longer, all I could do would be to bring
out the mere material in my possession in a rough form, leaving
the theories thereon to be elaborated by others. My difficulties
were great, but my reward has been in a mass of material, for
the elaboration of which International, Oriental, and other Congresses
and learned societies have petitioned Government since
1866. My official duties have hitherto prevented my addressing
myself to the congenial task of elaborating the material in conjunction
with others. In 1886, I was, however, put for a few
months on special duty in connexion with the Hunza language,
at the very time that Colonel Lockhart was traversing a portion
of Dardistan. But I think you will be more interested if, beyond
personal observations, I tell you something about that little
country of Hunza itself, which in many respects differs from those
surrounding it, not only in regard to its peculiar language, which
I have mentioned, but in other respects also. Unfortunately,
it is also unlike the surrounding districts, in being characterised
by customs the absence of some of which would
be desirable. The Hunzas are nominal Muhammedans, and they
use their mosques for drinking and dancing assemblies. Women
are as free as air. There is little restriction in the relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_8_Page_11" id="Appendix_8_Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of the sexes, and the management of the State, in theory, is
attributed to fairies. No war is undertaken unless the fairy
(whom, by the way, one is not allowed to see) gives the command
by beating the sacred drum. The witches, who get into an
ecstatic state, are the journalists, historians, and prophetesses of
the tribe. They tell you what goes on in the surrounding
valleys. They represent, as it were, the local <i>Times</i>; they tell
you the past glories, such as they are, of raids and murders by
their tribe; and when the <i>Tham</i> or ruler, who is supposed to be
heaven-born (there being some mystery about the origin of his
dynasty), does wrong, the only one who will dare to tell him the
truth is the Dayal, or the witch who prophesies the future, and
takes the opportunity of telling the Rajah that, unless he behaves
in a manner worthy of his origin, he will come to grief! This
is not a common form of popular representation to be met with,
say, in India. Grimm’s fairy-tales sometimes seem to be translated
into practise in Hunza-land, which offers material for discussion
alike to those who search for the Huns and to those who
search for the very different Honas.</p>

<p>Then with regard to religion, as I said before, though nominally
Muhammedan, they are really deniers of all the important precepts
of true Muhammedanism, which is opposed to drunkenness,
introduces a real brotherhood, and enjoins great cleanliness as
absolutely necessary before the spiritual purification by prayer
can take place. The people are mostly Muláis, but inferior in
piety (?) to those of Zébak, Shignán, Wakhan, and other places.
Now, what is that sect? It is represented by His Highness
Prince Aga Khan, of Bombay, a person who is not half aware of
his importance in those regions, where, till very recently, men
were murdered as soon as looked at. One who acknowledges
him or has brought some of the water with which he has washed
his feet, would always be able to pass through those regions
perfectly unharmed! I found my disguise as a Bokhara Mullah
in 1866 to be quite useless, as a protection at Gilgit, whence men
were kidnapped to be exchanged for a good hunting dog, but in
Hunza they used to fill prisoners with gunpowder, and blow them
up for general amusement. His Highness, who is much given
to horse-racing, confines his spiritual administration to the collection
of taxes throughout Central Asia from his followers or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_8_Page_12" id="Appendix_8_Page_12">[12]</a></span>
believers, and the believers themselves represent what is still
left of the doctrine of the Sheik-ul-Jabl or the Ancient of the
Mountain, the head of the so-called Assassins, a connexion of the
Mahdi, if he was the Mahdi, or the supposed Mahdi in the Soudan.
I consider he was not the Mahdi as foretold in Muhammedan
tradition; but, be that as it may, the 7th Imám of the Shiahs
has given rise to the sects both of the Druses in the Lebanon and
to the Hunzas on the Pamir. They are the existing Ismailians,
who, centuries ago, under the influence of <i>Hashish</i>, the Indian
hemp, committed crimes throughout Christendom, and were the
terror of Knight-Templars, as “Hashîshîn,” corrupted into
“Assassins.”</p>

<p>Now, I have been fortunate enough, owing to my friendship
with the head of their tribe, to obtain some portions of the
Kelám-i-pîr volume, which takes the place, really, of the Korán,
and of which I have got a portion here. I thought it might not
be unworthy of your society to bring this to your knowledge, as
a very interesting remnant which throws, <i>inter alia</i>, considerable
light not only on their doctrine, but also on the Crusades. By a
similar favour, I have had the opportunity of hearing the
Mitháq, or covenant of the Druses, and that covenant of the
Druses is a kind of prayer they offer up to God, not only in connexion
with the Old Man of the Mountain, the head of the
assassins who began about 1022, but also with those mysterious
rites which also take place in what I may call the fairy-land of
Hunza. With regard to the covenants, or one of them, which the
“U’qelá” or the “initiated” or “wise,” as distinguished from the
“Juhelá” or “ignorant” “laity,” among the Druses, offer up every
night, this was used by a so-called educated Druse, one who had
been converted to Protestantism,—a very good thing: but, as
often happens, with that denationalisation which renders his conversion
useless as a means for the promotion of any religion, as
there are no indigenous elements for its growth. Such a convert
is often unable to obtain a knowledge of the practices of his still
unconverted countrymen, as nobody can be looked upon with
greater distrust than that native of a country who has unlearnt
to think in his own language, and who cannot acquire a foreign
language with its associations, which are part of the history of
that language; he does not become an Englishman with English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_8_Page_13" id="Appendix_8_Page_13">[13]</a></span>
associations, but ceases to be a good native with his own indigenous
associations. Therefore, in my humble opinion, of all
the unfortunate specimens of mankind, the most degraded are
those who, under the guise of being Europeanised and, therefore,
reformers, have themselves the greatest necessity for reform.
Their mind has become completely unhinged, thereby showing
us that if we Europeans wish to do good among Orientals we
can do so best by living good lives in the midst of professors of
other religions, this being also in accordance with the 13th edict
of Asoka.</p>

<p>This Druse covenant makes the mad Fatimite ruler of Egypt,
Hákim, the “Lord of the Universe.” As I said before, the
present “Lord of the Universe”. for the Hunzas is the lineal
descendant of the 7th Imám, a resident of Bombay, one to whom
the Muláis make pilgrimages, instead of going to Mecca or to
Kerbelá. You may imagine that, even as regards the Druses,
there must be something higher than <i>their</i> “Lord of the Universe;”
but, such as he is, it is with him that this covenant is
made. Reverting to his living colleague, the Indian “Lord,” it
may be stated that there are men scattered throughout India of
whose influence we have only the faintest conception. I pointed
out in 1866 that if anyone wanted to follow successfully my
footsteps is Dardistan, he would have to get recommendations
from His Highness Aga Khan of Bombay, and I am glad to say
that Col. Lockhart has taken advantage of that recommendation.
The Druse “Lord of the Universe” is regarded as one with
whom nothing can be compared. The Druses are to render him
the most implicit obedience, and to carry out his behests at the
loss of everything, good name, wealth, and life, with the view of
obtaining the favour of one who may be taken to be God; but
the sentence is so constructed as to make him, if not God, only
second to God; in other words, only just a discrimination between
God as the distant ruler of the Universe and, perhaps,
some lineal descendant of Hákim, or rather, Hákim himself as
an ever-living being, as the ruler of <i>this</i> world. This and some
other prayers, with some songs, one amongst which breathes the
greatest hatred to Muhammedanism, and speaks of the destruction
of Mecca as something to look forward to, seems to be
deserving of study. There are also references in them to rites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_8_Page_14" id="Appendix_8_Page_14">[14]</a></span>
connected with Abraham. A full translation of these documents,
compared with invocations in portions of the Korán, would,
indeed, reward the attention of the student.</p>

<p>I will now again revert from the Druses of the Lebanon to
the Muláis in the Himalayas. I obtained the poem in my hand
from the head of that sect, and the wording is such that it denies
whilst affirming the immortality and transmigration of souls.
It says, “It is no use telling the ignorant multitude what your
faith is.” That is very much like what Lord Beaconsfield said—that
all thinking men were of one religion, but they would not
tell of what religion!—a wrong sentiment, but one that is
embodied in the above poem. “Tell them,” continues the poem
in effect, “if they want to know, in an answer of wisdom to a
question of folly: ‘if your life has been bad you will descend
into the stone the vegetable, or the animal; if your life has been
good you will return as a better man. The chain of life is undivided.
The animal that is sacrificed proceeds to a higher life.’
You cannot discriminate and yet deny individual life, and
apportion that air, stone, or plant, to the animal and to man, but
you ought to be punished for saying this to others!” And on
this principle, at any rate, the Druses also act or acted, that that
is no crime which is not found out; and a good many people, I
am sorry to say, elsewhere, think much the same; whereas in
Hunza they have gone beyond that stage, and care extremely
little about their crimes being found out. The Mitháq and other
religious utterances of the Druses and the Kelám-i-Pîr of the
Hunzas, if published together, with certain new information
which we have regarding the Crusade of Richard Cœur-de-Lion,
would, I think, were time given and the matter elaborated, indeed
deserve the attention of the readers of the “Transactions.”
It also seems strange that where such customs exist there should
be a prize for virtue, but there is one in Hunza for wives who
have remained faithful to their husbands, something like the
French prize for <i>rosières</i>.</p>

<p>Formerly Suttee was practised, but Suttee had rather the
meaning of Sáthi or companion, as both husband and wife went
to the funeral pyre. Prizes are similarly given to wives who
have not quarrelled for, say, a certain number of years with
their husbands. The most curious custom which seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_8_Page_15" id="Appendix_8_Page_15">[15]</a></span>
permeate these countries is to foster relationship in nursing, where
a nurse and all her relations come not only within the prohibited
degrees, which is against the spirit of Muhammedanism, but also
create the only real bond of true attachment that I have seen in
Dardistan, where other relatives seemed always engaged in
murdering one another.</p>

<p>Nearly all the chiefs in Dardistan give their children to
persons of low degree to nurse, and these and the children of
the nurse become attached to them throughout life and are their
only friends. But this foster-relationship is also taken in order
to get rid of the consequences, say, of crime; for instance, in the
case of adultery, or supposed adultery, the suspected person who
declares that he enters into the relationship of a son to the
woman with whom he is suspected, after a certain penalty, is
really accepted in that position, and the trust is in no case
betrayed. It is the only kind of forgiveness which is given in
Dardistan generally to that sort of transgression; but, further
than that, drinking milk with some one, or appointing some one
as foster-father, which is done by crossing two vases of milk,
creates the same relationship, except amongst the noble caste of
Shins, who were expelled by the Brahmins from India or Kashmir,
and who hold the cow in abhorence as one of their religious
dogmas, whereas, in other ways, they are really Brahmins, among
whom we find Hinduism peeping out through the thin crust of
Muhammedanism.</p>

<p>The subject of caste, by the way, is also one which is generally
misunderstood, and which, if developed on Christian lines, would
give us the perfection of human society, and solve many of the
problems with which we are dealing in Europe in more advanced
civilisations. I have just read with concern some remarks
against caste by Sir John Petheram, who has been in India some
three or four years. I think that before people speak on subjects
of such intricacy, they should take the position of students of
the question, learn at least one of the classical and one of the
vernacular languages of India, and then alone assume the role of
teachers whilst continuing to be learners; even in regard to such
subjects of infant-marriage and the prohibition of widow re-marriage,
there is a side of the question which has not yet been
put sufficiently before the British public. Infant-marriage, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_8_Page_16" id="Appendix_8_Page_16">[16]</a></span>
properly carried out in the higher castes, is an adoption of the
girl into the family where she and the husband grow up together
and join in prayer in common, which is necessary for their
respective salvation; there is much to learn in the way of tenderness,
charity, and love, from some of the households in India,
where we find a community constituted on the noblest principles
of “the joint family,” with an admirable and economical subdivision
of labour, which enables them to live for a mere trifle, and
yet so to prepare their food that in every dish you can see the
tender care of the woman who prepares it for the good of the
husband and of the household.</p>

<p>Then, as to the widow re-marriage, it has not been sufficiently
pointed out to the British public that spiritual marriage renders
the re-marriage of the Hindu widow impossible, because she is
necessary for the spiritual salvation of the husband, and because
as the representative of his property she may be called on to be
the head of the family, for many of them <i>are</i> at the head of the
family, and their position, therefore, renders it simply impossible
for them to re-marry. These are matters that we should treat
with respect, especially if we seek to adapt them to the spirit of
the age. There are also differences amongst Muhammedans as
great as there are between a Christian who tries to follow the
Sermon on the Mount and a nominal Christian. Science and
religion, according to a Muhammedan saying, are twins, and if
I understand the object of this Society, it is in order to make
this twinship (if I may be allowed to use the expression) more
real that your labours have been initiated, and that, under Providence,
they have been carried to the successful results that
have followed them both here and abroad.</p>

relationship is the one created by the foster-mother. The linguistic portion of “The

them, the name, I suppose, of some emblematic animal. I was however
unable to find out its meaning.” The word is ‎‏غضنفر ‏‎, Ghazanfar [which
means in <i>Arabic</i>: lion, hero] and is the name of the former ruler of Hunza
whose name is on the coins. In Hunza itself, coined money is unknown.

who had visited Chitrál did not know it by any other name than “Kashkar”
the name of the principal town, whilst Chitrál was called “a Kafir
village surrounded by mountains” by Neyk Muhammad, a Lughmáni
Nîmtsha (or half) Mussulman in 1866.</p>

Hunza when it becomes truly Muhammadan. In the meanwhile, my endeavour
in 1866 to find traces of Alexander the Great’s invasion in Dardistan,
has led to the adoption of the myth of descent from that Conqueror by
the Chinese Governor or the ancient hereditary “Thàm” of Hunza, who
really is “<i>ayeshó</i>,” or “heaven-born,” owing to the miraculous conception
of a female ancestor. “Mogholot” is the direct ancestor of the kindred
Nagyr line, “Girkis,” his twin-brother and deadly foe, being the ancestor
of the Hunza dynasty. (See Genealogy on pages <a href="#Page_69">69</a> and <a href="#Page_111">111</a>.)</p>

seemed inoffensive young men. They admitted drinking a portion of the

proceeds more from bravado than appetite. In “Davies’ Trade Report”

<p><a name="Footnote_76" id="Footnote_76"></a><a href="#FNanchor_76"><span class="label">[76]</span></a> My Sazîni says that the Dôms are below the Kramìns and that there
are only 4 original castes: Shîn, Yáshkunn, Kramìn [or “Kamìnn”] and
Dôm, who, to quote his words, occupy the following relative ranks: “The
Shîn is the right hand, the Yáshkunn the left; the Kramìn the right foot,
the Dôm the left foot.” “The other castes are mere names for occupations.”
A Shîn or Yáshkunn can trade, cultivate land or be a shepherd
without loss of dignity—Kramìns are weavers, carpenters, etc., but
not musicians—as for leather, it is not prepared in the country. Kramìns
who cultivate land consider themselves equal to Shîns. Dôms can follow
<i>any</i> employment, but, if a Dôm becomes a Mulla, he is respected.
Members of the several castes who misbehave are called Mîn, Pashgun,
Mamin and Môm respectively. “A man of good caste will espouse sides
and fight to the last even against his own brother.” Revenge is a duty, as
among Afghans, but is not transmitted from generation to generation, if
the first murderer is killed. A man who has killed another, by mistake,
in a fight or otherwise, seeks a frank forgiveness by bringing a rope, shroud
and a buffalo to the relatives of the deceased. The upper castes can, if
there are no Kramìns in their villages, do ironmonger’s and carpenter’s
work, without disgrace; but must wait for Kramìns or Dôms for weaver’s
work. The women spin. The “Dôms” are the “Rôms” of Gipsy lore.</p>

dragged off either to Chilás, Chitrál, Badakhshán or Bukhárá. The surveillance, however,
which is exercised over prisoners, as they are being moved by goat-paths over mountains,
cannot be a very effective one and, therefore, many of them escape. Some of the
Kashmir Maharajah’s Sepoys, who had invaded Dardistan, had been captured and had
escaped. They narrated many stories of the ferocity of these mountaineers; <i>e.g.</i>, that
they used their captives as fireworks, etc., etc., in order to enliven public gatherings.
Even if this be true, there can be no doubt that the Sepoys retaliated in the fiercest
manner whenever they had an opportunity, and the only acts of barbarism that came
under my observation, during the war with the tribes in 1866, were committed by the
Kashmir invaders.</p>

a punitive expedition against Chilás. This he did in 1851 or 1852. The Dogrâs at last

Maharajah, namely, Mir Vali and Mulk-Aman, and to make room for the more trusted
Pehliwan, Aman-ul-Mulk, the ruler of Chitrál and supposed instigator of the murder of
Hayward through the agency of Mir Vali of Yasin, wrote to the Maharajah to implicate
Mulk Aman in the business. Immediately on his flight, his wife and son were temporarily
imprisoned in the Fort of Gilgit. Pehliwan and Rahmat interceded for some of the servants,
who were set free and sent on to Chitrál. Mir Vali found his way to Chitrál,
whose ruler had one of Mr. Hayward’s guns, though the bulk of his property is said to
have been recovered. There he was seen by Major Montgomery’s Havildar, who reported
that Mir Vali was lame from a kick by a horse. This however, does not seem to have
prevented him from resuming the rule of Yasin in conjunction with Pehliwan or, if recent
accounts are to be trusted, from turning his nominal suzerain, Aman-ul-Mulk, out of
Chitrál. Mulk Aman also figured for a short time on the scene of the war with Aman-ul-Mulk

of Turkey and thus to take the place of the British as “the Protector of
Islám,” the news of the revision of the Korán by a Russian Censor and
the <i>bévue</i> of putting up the Czar’s portrait in Central Asian Mosques, have
injured Russia’s propaganda among Muhammadans, whom also the
accounts of the persecution of the Jews have estranged from a Power that
began its rule in Central Asia by repairing and constructing Mosques,
helping Mosque Schools and even subsidizing an employé to call “the
faithful” to fast and <i>break</i>-fast during the month of Ramazán.</p>

been killed by his own son, Muhammad Khan. Muhammad Khan’s
mother was the sister of Zafar Khan, the ruler of Nagyr. She was killed
by her father-in-law, Ghazanfar, and thrown over a precipice from her
house. Ghazan Khan treacherously killed his paternal uncle, Abdullah
Khan, ruler of Gojál, who unsuspectingly met him. On ascending the
throne, Ghazan Khan is also said to have poisoned his ailing full brother,
Bukhtawar Shah, and another (by a different Sayad mother) Nanawal Shah.
The fratricidal traditions of Hunza and of the Khush-waqtia family of Yasin
have now been somewhat thrown into the shade by the parricide of
Muhammad Khan. The father of Ghazan Khan, Ghazanfar, is said to
have died from the effects of a suit of clothes, impregnated with small-pox,
sent to him by his daughter, the full sister of Ghazan Khan, who was
married to Mir Shah of Badakhshan, in order to accelerate her brother’s
accession to the throne. The father of Ghazanfar, Sullum, also poisoned
his own father. This state of things is very different from the gentle rules
and traditions of Nagyr, whose aged Chief, Zafar Khan, has nineteen sons,
and who sent his rebellious eldest son. Muhammad Khan (whose mother
was a full sister of Ghazan Khan of Hunza) to Ramsu in Kashmir territory,
where he died. He was married to a daughter of his maternal uncle, and
tried to sell some of his Nagyr subjects into slavery, against the traditions
of that peaceful country, in consequence of which his father, Zafar Khan
expelled him.” (See Part referring to the History and Customs of Hunza
and Nagyr.) Yet it is this patriarchal, loyal and God-fearing Záfar Khan,
whose letter to me I published last year, whom we accused of kidnapping
and aggressiveness, so that we might take his country.</p>

At the same time, their comparison with an European may have some interest. His brachycephalic Cranial Index 81·44 may be compared with
those of dolichocephalic Matavalli 73·84, mesocephalic Khudáyár 78·7, mesocephalic Ghulám Muhammad 77·4, mesocephalic Ghulám 77, the exquisitely dolichocephalic Abdullah 72·53 and dolichocephalic Mîr Abdullah 73·82, which give an average of 75·55. The European’s circumference of head, 60 centimetres,
may also be compared with Abdul Ghafûr’s, 53·7½; Khudayâr’s, 52·5; Ibrahîm’s, 56·5; Matavalli’s, 54; Sultan Ali’s, 53·75; Khudádad’s and Hatamu’s, 54·4; and Ghulam Mahammad’s, 54; which give the circumference of the heads of the eight Dards and Kafirs on the first page. This Table supplies further

Shah Madkasan, who is learned, good-natured, and friendly to travellers....
The people give a tenth of their income to their preceptors; if one
has ten children, he consecrates one to Shah Abdur-Rahim.... The
inhabitants are strong and hardy; the women do not cover their faces
from strangers. Although Shiahs, they have no mosques and repeat no
prayers. Abdur-Rahim has one in his village, where <i>he</i> prays. Every
morning at <i>Chasht</i> (the middle hour between sunrise and noon) he sits in
the assembly and distributes breads of wheat among the members, followed
by the servants handing round tea in porcelain cups in which each one
soaks his bread, and, after eating it, lifts his hand to bless the giver, a
custom also followed by the nobles on entering the assembly. If Shah
Abdur-Rahim addresses any of them, he rises from his seat and answers as
if he were reading a <i>ruka’t</i> at the time of praying, and then returns to his
place, and sits on his knees, for to sit otherwise is reckoned a sin amongst

Fatimite Khalifa of Cairo (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 996-1020), who was the head and originator
of the special Ismailian sect, which became subsequently known to the Crusaders
under the name of the “Assassins”—a corruption of “Hashishin,”
or drinkers of Hashish (<i>Canabis Indica</i>)—commences with titles of governorship
or Age which would seem (to the uninitiated) to be compatible with
his subordination to the Deity, although, for practical purposes, Al-Hákim
is the “ruler of this world,” whether for good or for evil. He is, therefore,
the Prince of this world, if not Apollyon, and the fact that the words
“Valî” = a deputed governor or “Hákim” = a governor, may cause him
to be confounded with either an ordinary ruler, or be merely ringing the
changes on his own name of “Al-Hákim,” it is clear, at any rate to the
initiated, that the only Deity worth caring for is thereby meant, and that
he began with the Khalifa Al-Hákim, who lives for ever. In the titles
“Maula” and “Valî” there is also an allusion to A’li, who is “next to
God,” and from whom Al-Hákim was descended. The Mauláis or Muláis
of the Hindukush use similar titles for their spiritual head, whether dead,
or continuing in his lineal descendant, Agha Khan of Bombay. The
“Kelám-i-Pîr,” or “the Logos or word of the Pîr or ancient sage,” mainly
refers to the sayings attributed to the “Sheikh-ul-Jabl,” or “Old Man of
the Mountain.” In Hunza itself, the Muláis equally address their practical
Deity as “The Ancient of the Age,” or “Pîr-uz-Zamán.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_146" id="Footnote_146"></a><a href="#FNanchor_146"><span class="label">[146]</span></a> In discussion, whenever expedient, with a Brahmin, or even Buddhist,
the belief in a modified metempsychosis would form a bond of sympathy
(see last A. Q. R.), whilst the survival “of the most adapted,” rather than
that of “the best,”—without, however, the loss of any individual or type,—would
be connected with the notion of a certain fixed number of souls in
evolution from “the beginning” and ever recurrent in living form. “The
beginning,” however, would be a mere term applying to this or that
revealed condition, for behind what may be called “the terrestrial gods,”
behind Allah in whatever form, Deity or Deities, there was The <span class="smcap">Being</span>
that existed without a beginning and whose first manifestation was the
“Word” with its Replica as the type of the apostle and his fellow that ever
succeeded itself throughout the generations of this world. If the visible
Deity, preferring to show itself in human, rather than any other, form, is
incorporated in the lineal descendant of the 7th Imám, it is, apparently,
because humanity requires such an unbroken link in order to convert into
certainty its hope of the deliverer, the Messiah, the Mahdi, the second
[advent of] Jesus, who will similarly be the Deity in the shape of a man,
reconciling the various expectations of all religions in one manifestation.
That few, if any, Muláis, or even the most “initiated” Druses, should
know <i>every</i> variety of their belief, is natural, not only in consequence of
varying degrees of mental ability and of corresponding “initiation,” but also
because of varied historical or national surroundings, circumstances
which underlie the guiding principle of all Mulái belief and practice. I
venture to indicate, <i>as purely my personal impression</i>, that this principle, which
need not be further explained in this place, is the real secret of that faith.
In my humble opinion, the <i>disjecta membra</i>, so to speak, of that faith form,
if reconstituted, an embodiment of the religious thought of the World that
seeks to reconcile all differences in one Philosophy and in one Policy.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_147" id="Footnote_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_147"><span class="label">[147]</span></a> In the interior of Arabia, Mr. W. B. Harris has come across a curious
sect that may be connected with a section of the Kerámis or Keramátis,
sects that gave much trouble in Syria in the 10th century, or, more probably,
with an extreme and, probably, disavowed heterodox sub-sect of the
Ismailians. It may be interesting to quote the correspondence that has
taken place between us on the subject:</p>

<p class="right">Tangier, <i>April 5, 1893</i>.</p>

<p>“During my journey through the Yemen last year I came across a sect
of people calling themselves <i>Makarama</i>, of whom I was able to learn little,
on account of their own reticence and the apparent want of interest of
their Moslem neighbours. However, one of their number gave me a
couple of lines of Arabic poetry, which translated, run:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“God is unknown—by day or by night.</div>
<div class="verse">Why trouble about him, there is no heaven and no hell.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All that I could find out about them in addition to this is that they hold
an annual nightly feast with closed doors and lights in the windows, in
which they are said to practise incest; and that they annually practise the
form of driving a scapegoat into the mountains. The latter is clearly
Judaic and the former custom savours of the Karmathians, but this seems
improbable as the people are not Moslems. They are visited, it is said, by
certain Indians who prize the charms written by these Yemenis. Beyond
this I was able to discover nothing.</p>

<p>I have no valuable books of reference as to religions here, but if I
remember aright there were Phœnician rites resembling this. Could it
have anything to do with the Sabeans? I should be so grateful to you if
you could let me know, when you have time, what you think about it. I
can find no reference to them in any work on the Yemen. The name of
the sect is, I suppose, of Persian origin.</p>

<p class="right">Vichy, <i>April 14, 1893</i>.</p>

<p>I, too, am not here within the reach of books of reference. I will, however,
try to suggest what occurs to me on the spur of the moment in the hope
that it may possibly be of some slight use in your enquiries. It is very
important, first of all, to learn how “Makarama” is spelt by the Yemen
people in the Arabic character, and especially whether the “k” is a “kef”
or a “qaf” ‎‏ق ‏‎. Then the lines you quote should be sent to me in the
original Arabic dialect and character (not the Maghrebi form, of course) and
transliterated in Roman characters<a name="FNanchor" id="FNanchor"></a><a href="#Footnote" class="fnanchor">*</a> <i>as you heard them</i>, for a good deal
depends, <i>inter alia</i>, on the Arabic equivalents, used by “the Makarama” of
“God,” “heaven,” and “hell.” ... The sentiment of the translation is
the <i>Mulái</i> of Hunza, about whom I have written in the last <i>Asiatic
Quarterly Review</i>....</p>

<p>How do you know that the people are <i>not</i> Moslems? That their
orthodox Muhammadan neighbours do not admit them to be such, is not
conclusive, for I have heard rigid Sunnis even exclude Shiahs from that
appellation. If you could remember the <i>exact</i> question which you put on
that subject to your Mukarama friends and their precise reply, it might
help to a conclusion.</p>

<p>Driving a scapegoat into the mountains is a common practice among
the Afghans, who call themselves “Beni Israel” (not to be confounded
with the <i>Jews</i> properly so called—their “Musáis” or “Yahûdis”). The other
rites you speak of <i>were alleged</i> against the Karmathians and the Yazîdis
<i>are</i> accused of them. Have you thought of the Yazîdis? The accusation
of incestuous gatherings is, as you know, constantly brought by “the
orthodox” against sectarians and I would not, in your place, give up the
conjecture of a Karmathian origin of the “Makarama,” before you have
gone further into the matter. Please, therefore, to remember <i>all you can</i>
about your friends and, if I can, I shall aid your enquiry to the best of my
ability. I think you are right about the Phœnician rites and the Sabean
conjecture.</p>

<p>I do not think that “Makarama” is of Persian origin. Is it possibly
“<i>Mu</i>karama” or “<i>Mu</i>karrima”? If so, this would be an appropriate title
for a specially “blessed” or enlightened sect. Why do you call them a
“<i>sect</i>”? Are they also ethnographically distinct from their neighbours and
what are their occupations? Could you get me a copy of one of their
<i>charms</i>? Their being visited by certain Indians would rather show their
Ismailian connexion than that they are not a heretical Muhammadan sect.
Indeed, among the Ismailian sects mentioned by Makrizi as having spread
in Yemen, among other countries, are “the <i>Kerámis</i>, <i>Karmátis</i>, Khárijis,
etc.,” “all of whom studied philosophy and chose what suited them.” I
really think these are your “Makaráma.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote" id="Footnote"></a><a href="#FNanchor"><sup>*</sup></a> I think “romanizing” the Oriental characters a great mistake, except
“to make assurance doubly sure.” The <i>Arabic</i> spelling would at once
limit conjectures and lead to a solution.</p>
